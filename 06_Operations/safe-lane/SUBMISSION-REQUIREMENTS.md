# Safe Lane Submission Requirements

**Version:** v0.1 (February 2026)
**Audience:** Filmmakers submitting work for SI8 representation and catalog inclusion
**Purpose:** Everything SI8 needs to complete a Safe Lane review and issue a Rights Package

---

## Before You Submit

SI8 represents AI-generated and AI-assisted films through a documented vetting process called the Safe Lane. Completing this submission is what enables your work to be:
- Included in SI8's catalog for commercial licensing (Tier 1)
- Considered for AI product placement deals with brands (Tier 2)

This is not a legal certification. It is a documented process. The more complete and accurate your submission, the stronger your Rights Package — and the more valuable your work is to buyers.

If you have questions before submitting, contact SI8 directly.

## Section 3: Tool Disclosure

**One row per tool used.** Include every AI tool used in production, including tools used for audio, upscaling, or post-processing.

| Tool Name | Version / Model | Plan Type (Free / Paid / Enterprise) | Commercial License Confirmed? | Receipt or Confirmation on File? |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| | | | Y/N | Y/N |
| | | | Y/N | Y/N |
| | | | Y/N | Y/N |

**Paid commercial plan receipts or subscription confirmation screenshots are required for each tool listed.** This is the foundation of the commercial use authorization in your Rights Package. Without receipts, the submission cannot proceed.

*Note: SI8 maintains a tool risk tier list (Approved / Caution / Prohibited) based on commercial terms, active litigation exposure, and training data risk. Tools not on the Approved list require additional review. See the Rights Playbook for current tier assignments.*

## Section 4: Human Authorship Declaration

**Written statement required. Minimum 150 words.**

This is the copyright protection layer. Under current US, Taiwan, and Singapore law, AI-generated content without meaningful human authorship may not qualify for copyright protection. Your declaration documents the human creative decisions that make this work yours.

Your statement must describe:
- What prompts you wrote and how you developed them
- Decisions you made during iteration (what you kept, what you rejected, and why)
- Editorial choices: pacing, structure, scene selection, composition decisions
- Any post-generation editing: color, cuts, sound design, titles
- How you directed the overall creative process

**Generic statements ("I wrote the prompts") are insufficient and will result in a Conditional Pass pending expansion.**

The standard is: could another human, reading your declaration, understand the creative decisions you made? If yes, it passes. If not, it needs more detail.

## Section 5: Likeness & Identity Confirmation

Review each item and confirm with a checkmark or written "Confirmed."

- [ ] No identifiable real person's face appears in this work
- [ ] No voice that is a clone or imitation of a real person appears in this work
- [ ] No character that is a lookalike for a specific real person appears in this work
- [ ] No synthetic version of a real person (living or deceased) appears in this work
- [ ] If any face appears that could be mistaken for a real person, describe here: ___

**This is a hard line. No exceptions. Any "yes" on the above requires immediate disclosure before review proceeds.**

---

## Section 6: IP & Brand Confirmation

Review each item and confirm with a checkmark or written "Confirmed."

- [ ] No copyrighted characters, creatures, or fictional IP appear in this work (e.g., no recognizable film/TV/game characters)
- [ ] No recognizable brand imitation appears (e.g., no content that replicates or parodies a real brand's trade dress without authorization)
- [ ] No trademarked logos, slogans, or brand identifiers appear
- [ ] If any element could be interpreted as referencing real IP, describe here: ___

*Note: Ambiguous cases are documented in SI8's EDGE-CASES log and may require additional review.*

## Section 7: Audio & Music Disclosure

All audio must be accounted for. Select the applicable category for each audio element:

**Score / Background Music:**
- [ ] Original — generated by AI tool (specify tool: ___)
- [ ] Licensed — provide license documentation (license type, licensor, license file attached)
- [ ] Silent — no music

**Sound Design / Ambient Audio:**
- [ ] Original — generated by AI tool (specify tool: ___)
- [ ] Licensed — provide license documentation
- [ ] No sound design

**Voiceover / Narration:**
- [ ] Original — filmmaker's own voice
- [ ] AI-generated — specify tool and confirm commercial license: ___
- [ ] No voiceover

**Unlicensed commercial music tracks are grounds for rejection.** If you are uncertain about a track's licensing status, do not include it and contact SI8 before submitting.

*v0.1 default: SI8 takes a conservative position on music rights. Edge cases will be flagged for legal review. When in doubt, use original AI audio or silence.*

## Section 8: Tier 2 Brand Placement — Enrollment (Optional)

**What Tier 2 is and what it pays.**

Tier 2 is SI8's AI product placement program. Brands pay a premium to have their products integrated into catalog films through AI regeneration — no reshoot, no disruption to your work. If your film is selected for a Tier 2 deal:

- You receive compensation above the standard Tier 1 catalog license rate. Tier 2 deals are priced at a premium above Tier 1.
- You are informed of the brand and proposed scene before any deal closes. You can decline any match that doesn't fit your work.
- You retain authorship credit on the original film.
- SI8 coordinates all brand communication and production. You do not need to be involved in the regeneration process.
- You can limit which scenes are eligible — or enroll the full film.

Enrollment is optional. Your answer here does not affect Tier 1 catalog consideration. You can update your selection at any time.

**Do you want to be considered for Tier 2 brand placement deals?**

- [ ] **Yes — full film.** Consider any scene in this work for brand placement. SI8 will contact me before any deal closes.
- [ ] **Yes — specific scenes only.** Consider only the following scenes: ___
- [ ] **Not now — Tier 1 only.** Consider this work for catalog licensing only. I can enroll in Tier 2 later.

*Prerequisite: Tier 2 enrollment is only active if your Shopping Agreement includes a modification clause. If it doesn't yet, select "Not now" — we can activate Tier 2 eligibility when the agreement is updated.*

## Section 9: Territory & Exclusivity Preferences

| Field | Response |
|-------|---------|
| Preferred licensing territory | Global / APAC only / Specific regions: ___ |
| Any territories where this work cannot be licensed (existing agreements, restrictions) | Y/N — if yes, describe |
| Exclusivity preference for catalog licensing | Open (non-exclusive preferred) / Exclusive deals acceptable (case-by-case) |
| Any existing streaming, festival, or distribution agreements that restrict territory or exclusivity | Y/N — if yes, attach or describe |

*Note: SI8's default for catalog licensing is non-exclusive. Exclusive deals require additional negotiation and are priced accordingly.*
