# Safe Lane Submission Requirements

**Version:** v0.1 (February 2026)
**Audience:** Filmmakers submitting work for SI8 representation and catalog inclusion
**Purpose:** Everything SI8 needs to complete a Safe Lane review and issue a Rights Package

---

## Before You Submit

SI8 represents AI-generated and AI-assisted films through a documented vetting process called the Safe Lane. Completing this submission is what enables your work to be:
- Included in SI8's catalog for commercial licensing (Tier 1)
- Considered for AI product placement deals with brands (Tier 2)

This is not a legal certification. It is a documented process. The more complete and accurate your submission, the stronger your Rights Package — and the more valuable your work is to buyers.

If you have questions before submitting, contact SI8 directly.

## Section 3: Tool Disclosure

**One row per tool used.** Include every AI tool used in production, including tools used for audio, upscaling, or post-processing.

| Tool Name | Version / Model | Plan Type (Free / Paid / Enterprise) | Commercial License Confirmed? | Receipt or Confirmation on File? |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| | | | Y/N | Y/N |
| | | | Y/N | Y/N |
| | | | Y/N | Y/N |

**Paid commercial plan receipts or subscription confirmation screenshots are required for each tool listed.** This is the foundation of the commercial use authorization in your Rights Package. Without receipts, the submission cannot proceed.

*Note: SI8 maintains a tool risk tier list (Approved / Caution / Prohibited) based on commercial terms, active litigation exposure, and training data risk. Tools not on the Approved list require additional review. See the Rights Playbook for current tier assignments.*

## Section 4: Human Authorship Declaration

**Written statement required. Minimum 150 words.**

This is the copyright protection layer. Under current US, Taiwan, and Singapore law, AI-generated content without meaningful human authorship may not qualify for copyright protection. Your declaration documents the human creative decisions that make this work yours.

Your statement must describe:
- What prompts you wrote and how you developed them
- Decisions you made during iteration (what you kept, what you rejected, and why)
- Editorial choices: pacing, structure, scene selection, composition decisions
- Any post-generation editing: color, cuts, sound design, titles
- How you directed the overall creative process

**Generic statements ("I wrote the prompts") are insufficient and will result in a Conditional Pass pending expansion.**

The standard is: could another human, reading your declaration, understand the creative decisions you made? If yes, it passes. If not, it needs more detail.

## Section 5: Likeness & Identity Confirmation

Review each item and confirm with a checkmark or written "Confirmed."

- [ ] No identifiable real person's face appears in this work
- [ ] No voice that is a clone or imitation of a real person appears in this work
- [ ] No character that is a lookalike for a specific real person appears in this work
- [ ] No synthetic version of a real person (living or deceased) appears in this work
- [ ] If any face appears that could be mistaken for a real person, describe here: ___

**This is a hard line. No exceptions. Any "yes" on the above requires immediate disclosure before review proceeds.**

---

## Section 6: IP & Brand Confirmation

Review each item and confirm with a checkmark or written "Confirmed."

- [ ] No copyrighted characters, creatures, or fictional IP appear in this work (e.g., no recognizable film/TV/game characters)
- [ ] No recognizable brand imitation appears (e.g., no content that replicates or parodies a real brand's trade dress without authorization)
- [ ] No trademarked logos, slogans, or brand identifiers appear
- [ ] If any element could be interpreted as referencing real IP, describe here: ___

*Note: Ambiguous cases are documented in SI8's EDGE-CASES log and may require additional review.*

## Section 7: Audio & Music Disclosure

All audio must be accounted for. Select the applicable category for each audio element:

**Score / Background Music:**
- [ ] Original — generated by AI tool (specify tool: ___)
- [ ] Licensed — provide license documentation (license type, licensor, license file attached)
- [ ] Silent — no music

**Sound Design / Ambient Audio:**
- [ ] Original — generated by AI tool (specify tool: ___)
- [ ] Licensed — provide license documentation
- [ ] No sound design

**Voiceover / Narration:**
- [ ] Original — filmmaker's own voice
- [ ] AI-generated — specify tool and confirm commercial license: ___
- [ ] No voiceover

**Unlicensed commercial music tracks are grounds for rejection.** If you are uncertain about a track's licensing status, do not include it and contact SI8 before submitting.

*v0.1 default: SI8 takes a conservative position on music rights. Edge cases will be flagged for legal review. When in doubt, use original AI audio or silence.*

## Section 8: Modification Rights Authorization

**This section determines Tier 2 eligibility.**

AI product placement (Tier 2) requires SI8 to commission AI-regenerated versions of specific scenes — with brand elements integrated — without a reshoot. This is only possible if you authorize it.

**Do you authorize SI8 to commission AI-regenerated brand-integrated versions of this work for Tier 2 placement deals?**

- [ ] **Yes — full work.** SI8 may commission regenerated versions of any scene.
- [ ] **Yes — specific scenes only.** Describe which scenes are authorized: ___
- [ ] **No.** This work is submitted for Tier 1 licensing only.

**If yes:** You will be consulted on all Tier 2 deals and will receive compensation as defined in your Shopping Agreement. Regenerated versions are derivative works; terms are specified in the agreement.

**If no:** Your work will be considered for Tier 1 catalog licensing only. You can update this authorization at any time.

*Note: A modification clause in your Shopping Agreement is a prerequisite for Tier 2. If your agreement does not yet include this clause, select "No" for now — it can be updated when the agreement is amended.*

## Section 9: Territory & Exclusivity Preferences

| Field | Response |
|-------|---------|
| Preferred licensing territory | Global / APAC only / Specific regions: ___ |
| Any territories where this work cannot be licensed (existing agreements, restrictions) | Y/N — if yes, describe |
| Exclusivity preference for catalog licensing | Open (non-exclusive preferred) / Exclusive deals acceptable (case-by-case) |
| Any existing streaming, festival, or distribution agreements that restrict territory or exclusivity | Y/N — if yes, attach or describe |

*Note: SI8's default for catalog licensing is non-exclusive. Exclusive deals require additional negotiation and are priced accordingly.*
