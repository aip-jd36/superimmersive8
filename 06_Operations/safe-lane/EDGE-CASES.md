# Rights Verified Edge Cases

**Version:** v0.1 (February 2026)
**Audience:** SI8 internal reviewer
**Purpose:** A growing log of gray areas, judgment calls, and precedents set during real submissions. Each entry becomes precedent for handling similar cases in the future.

## How to Use This Document

When a submission raises a question that isn't clearly answered by REVIEW-CRITERIA.md, document it here before making a decision. This does two things:
1. Forces clear thinking before committing to a judgment call
2. Creates a searchable record so future reviewers apply consistent decisions

Each entry follows the same format. Entries are numbered sequentially. Never delete entries — mark them as superseded if a later decision changes the precedent.

**When to create an entry:**
- A submission contains something not covered by existing criteria
- Existing criteria is ambiguous for this specific case
- You're about to make a judgment call that could go either way
- A filmmaker challenges a rejection and raises a valid point

**When NOT to create an entry:**
- The criteria is clear and the case fits cleanly into Pass or Fail
- The issue is just missing documentation (request it; don't log it here)

## Log

*No entries yet. This document is initialized at v0.1. First entry will be created during the first real submission.*

*Expected first entries:*
- Music rights edge cases (v0.1 stance is conservative; real submissions will test the boundaries)
- Likeness borderline cases (AI faces that resemble celebrities without being clearly identical)
- IP similarity questions (work that references real-world aesthetics without direct imitation)
- Authorship declaration quality questions (what's the minimum that passes)
