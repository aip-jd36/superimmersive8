# Rights Playbook — Decisions Log

A record of what changed between versions, why, and what was left unresolved.

---

## v0.1 — February 2026

**Use case served:**
- Filmmaker call (post-Lunar New Year)
- MyVideo proposal to Jamie Lin
- Basic credibility signal for SEA agency outreach

**What's in it:**
- Safe Lane (what SI8 will and won't work with)
- Legal landscape: copyright, training data, likeness, disclosure
- Platform disclosure table (YouTube, TikTok, iQIYI, Viu, MyVideo)
- Tool commercial use table
- Full appendix of sources

**Key decisions made:**
- "AI-assisted, human-directed" framing is the legal and brand standard — validated by US, Taiwan, and Singapore law
- Tool tiers added based on litigation research — Runway/Pika safest, Kling flagged for exclusivity, Veo consumer prohibited, Hailuo high-risk
- iQIYI added as active distribution opportunity (running AI film program early 2026)
- Proactive disclosure is SI8 policy regardless of platform requirement
- User liability explicitly flagged — filmmakers are not shielded by tool choice
- Kling training data clause highlighted as exclusivity risk

**Still unresolved (carry to v0.2):**
- MyVideo platform policy (ask Jamie Lin)
- Viu platform policy (direct contact)
- Music and audio rights
- Festival-specific requirements
- EU and Japan jurisdiction breakdown
- Taiwan Copyright Bureau guidelines (no release date)
- **Per-asset documentation SKU schema** — v0.2 must include the standardized field set for every catalog entry: tool provenance log, model disclosure, Safe Lane sign-off, commercial use authorization, modification rights status, category conflict log, territory log, regeneration rights status, version history. This is the structured data layer that every Rights Package is built from.

## Pre-v0.1 (February 2026)

**Use case this version must serve:**
- Filmmaker call (post-Lunar New Year)
- MyVideo proposal to Jamie Lin
- Basic credibility signal for SEA agency outreach

**Key decisions made:**
- v0.1 = 3 pages max. No more. Resist the urge to go deep.
- Structure: Safe Lane (p.1) + Legal Landscape (p.2) + Platform Summary (p.3)
- Positioning all SI8 content as "AI-assisted, human-directed" — not pure AI output
- Proactive disclosure is policy (label AI content on all submissions)
- No content from tools in active IP litigation without additional review

**Still unresolved:**
- MyVideo's actual platform policy (need to ask Jamie Lin)
- Taiwan-specific copyright guidance
- Specific tool-by-tool terms of service review
