# Rights Playbook — Decisions Log

A record of what changed between versions, why, and what was left unresolved.

---

## v0.2 — February 2026

**Trigger:** Comprehensive legal research completed (Claude + ChatGPT + Gemini merged analysis)

**What's new:**
- **Colorado AI Act safe harbor:** "Rebuttable presumption of reasonable care" for documented systems — explicit legal safe harbor language that rewards SI8's Chain of Title approach
- **USCO copyrightability requirements:** Expanded human authorship section with Jan 2025 Part 2 Report findings — prompts alone ≠ authorship
- **DMCA CMI preservation:** Added § 1202/1203 requirements (no watermark/attribution stripping) — separate violation from infringement
- **EU AI Act Article 50:** Transparency obligations for synthetic content (phased 2026+)
- **NY synthetic performer disclosure law:** $1K-$5K fines for undisclosed synthetic performers in ads (effective 2026)
- **Quantifiable legal metrics section:** 73% damage reduction, regulatory penalties avoided, copyrightability protection
- **Competitive landscape section:** Adobe Firefly limitations clarified (indemnifies Firefly only, NOT third-party tools like Runway/Sora), C2PA vs. SI8 differentiation (provenance vs. legal safety)
- **Innocent infringer defense:** Expanded with statutory damages table, Copyright Alliance quote, Chain of Title field mapping

**Key decisions made:**
- Human Authorship Declaration now mandatory (150+ words minimum) — required for copyrightability per USCO
- CMI preservation is Rights Verified requirement (no watermark stripping) — DMCA compliance
- "73% damage reduction" is defensible marketing claim (statutory framework, triple-verified)
- "Rebuttable presumption of reasonable care" (Colorado) validates Chain of Title as compliance infrastructure
- C2PA commoditizes provenance; SI8's moat is subjective legal review (judgment layer)
- Adobe's indemnification gap is SI8's competitive opening: "Adobe = safe but boring. SI8 = best tools made safe."

**Still unresolved (carry to v0.3):**
- E&O insurance broker-validated underwriting requirements (hypothesis needs validation)
- Music and audio rights (complex; flag edge cases for legal review)
- Festival-specific requirements
- Taiwan Copyright Bureau guidelines (no release date)
- MyVideo platform policy (ask Jamie Lin)
- Viu platform policy (direct contact)

## v0.1 — February 2026

**Use case served:**
- Filmmaker call (post-Lunar New Year)
- MyVideo proposal to Jamie Lin
- Basic credibility signal for SEA agency outreach

**What's in it:**
- Rights Verified (what SI8 will and won't work with)
- Legal landscape: copyright, training data, likeness, disclosure
- Platform disclosure table (YouTube, TikTok, iQIYI, Viu, MyVideo)
- Tool commercial use table
- Full appendix of sources

**Key decisions made:**
- "AI-assisted, human-directed" framing is the legal and brand standard — validated by US, Taiwan, and Singapore law
- Tool tiers added based on litigation research — Runway/Pika safest, Kling flagged for exclusivity, Veo consumer prohibited, Hailuo high-risk
- iQIYI added as active distribution opportunity (running AI film program early 2026)
- Proactive disclosure is SI8 policy regardless of platform requirement
- User liability explicitly flagged — filmmakers are not shielded by tool choice
- Kling training data clause highlighted as exclusivity risk

**Still unresolved (carry to v0.2):**
- MyVideo platform policy (ask Jamie Lin)
- Viu platform policy (direct contact)
- Music and audio rights
- Festival-specific requirements
- EU and Japan jurisdiction breakdown
- Taiwan Copyright Bureau guidelines (no release date)
- **Per-asset documentation SKU schema** — ~~v0.2 carry-forward~~ **RESOLVED in February 2026.** The 9-field schema (tool provenance log, model disclosure, Rights Verified sign-off, commercial use authorization, modification rights status, category conflict log, territory log, regeneration rights status, version history) is now fully documented in `06_Operations/rights-verified/RIGHTS-PACKAGE-SCHEMA.md`. That document is the authoritative source. The Rights Verified project (`06_Operations/rights-verified/`) is the operational home for all Chain of Title schema work going forward.

## Pre-v0.1 (February 2026)

**Use case this version must serve:**
- Filmmaker call (post-Lunar New Year)
- MyVideo proposal to Jamie Lin
- Basic credibility signal for SEA agency outreach

**Key decisions made:**
- v0.1 = 3 pages max. No more. Resist the urge to go deep.
- Structure: Rights Verified (p.1) + Legal Landscape (p.2) + Platform Summary (p.3)
- Positioning all SI8 content as "AI-assisted, human-directed" — not pure AI output
- Proactive disclosure is policy (label AI content on all submissions)
- No content from tools in active IP litigation without additional review

**Still unresolved:**
- MyVideo's actual platform policy (need to ask Jamie Lin)
- Taiwan-specific copyright guidance
- Specific tool-by-tool terms of service review
