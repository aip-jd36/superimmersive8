## Bottom Line for SI8

**Taiwan and Singapore both require human authorship** — consistent with the US position. SI8's "AI-assisted, human-directed" framing holds across all three jurisdictions.

**Singapore is the most permissive APAC jurisdiction** for AI content — good news for SEA agency outreach. Taiwan is more restrictive but pending new guidelines.

**The APAC region is fragmented** — no unified standard yet. SI8's Rights Verified approach (documented human creative direction, no celebrity likeness, proper consent) aligns well with emerging norms across the region.

## Taiwan (TIPO)

**Current position (June 2023 official guidance — still in effect):**
- AI-generated works WITHOUT human creative input are NOT eligible for copyright protection under Taiwan's Copyright Act
- If a creator's contribution is limited only to providing prompts, the work may NOT be copyright-protected
- The greater the degree of human participation, the greater the likelihood of protection
- Using copyrighted works to train AI models may infringe the copyright owner's reproduction right (unless fair use applies)

**Upcoming:** Taiwan's Copyright Bureau is developing comprehensive guidelines covering:
- Reasonable use of training data
- Whether AI-generated works are eligible for copyright protection
- No fixed release date as of early 2026

**Practical implication:** Filmmakers represented by SI8 must be able to demonstrate human creative direction, editing decisions, and iteration — not just prompt entry. Document the process.

## Singapore (IPOS)

**Current position (2025):**
- Only natural persons (humans) can be authors of works under Singapore's Copyright Act 2021
- **AI-Generated** (no human intervention): likely NOT copyrightable
- **AI-Assisted** (AI used as a tool): copyrightable IF human exercised creativity in prompting AND editing

**Copyright depends on:**
1. Extent of human creativity in the prompting process
2. Extent of subsequent editing of the output
3. Nature of the generative AI output

**Computational Data Analysis (CDA) Exception:**
- Section 244, Copyright Act 2021
- Allows use of copyrighted material for AI training/data mining under specified conditions
- Notably MORE permissive than Taiwan on training data

**Recent activity:**
- Feb 2024: IPOS + Singapore Management University published "When Code Creates" — landscape report on AI/IP across jurisdictions
- May 2025: New patent acceleration programme (SG Patents Fast) launched
- Oct 2024: Supplemental guidance for AI-related patent applications
- March 2025: Ministry of Law developing guidelines for lawyers using generative AI

**Practical implication:** Singapore is the most favorable APAC jurisdiction for AI film distribution. Human creative involvement in prompting AND editing = sufficient for copyright protection. Good foundation for SEA agency conversations.

## Broader APAC / SEA

| Jurisdiction | AI Copyright Stance | Training Data | Disclosure Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Taiwan** | Human authorship required; prompts alone insufficient | May infringe reproduction right | No current mandate; guidelines pending | Most relevant to SI8 base |
| **Singapore** | Human authorship required; CDA exception for training | More permissive (CDA exception) | No current mandate | Most progressive APAC framework |
| **China / South Korea** | Human authorship required | Varies | **Yes — watermarks/disclosure mandated** | Relevant if distributing to these markets |
| **Thailand** | Intent-based infringement | Regulatory sandbox in progress | No current mandate | Draft AI Act in development |
| **Vietnam** | No clear AI-specific provisions | Operator responsibility required | No current mandate | Digital platform operators must evaluate AI use |

**ASEAN (Feb 2024):** Non-binding AI Governance and Ethics Guide — soft law, ethical guidelines only. Principles: transparency, fairness, security, privacy, accountability.

## Regional Trend: Watermarking & Disclosure

- China and South Korea have introduced rules requiring watermarks/disclosure for AI-generated content
- No equivalent mandate yet in Taiwan or Singapore
- Likely developing — SI8's proactive disclosure policy positions ahead of this curve

---

## Implications for SI8

**Rights Playbook:**
- Dual guidance for Taiwan and Singapore (human creativity must be documented in both)
- Reference ASEAN principles for APAC-wide credibility
- Note Taiwan guidelines as pending — build flexibility into playbook

**Filmmaker Agreement:**
- Require filmmakers to document their creative process (prompts, iterations, editorial decisions)
- Clear attribution of creative decisions to human director/editor — not AI tool
- Include consent/rights clearance for any identifiable real-world elements

**SEA Agency Outreach:**
- Singapore: Emphasize AI-assisted workflow with human creativity documentation
- Thailand: Emphasize intent-based safety (deliberate avoidance of infringing prompts)
- Vietnam: Emphasize clear operator responsibility through contractual documentation
- Avoid claiming "AI-generated" — always "AI-assisted, human-directed"

**Watch list:**
- Taiwan Copyright Bureau comprehensive guidelines (no date — check quarterly)
- China/South Korea watermarking requirements expanding to other markets
