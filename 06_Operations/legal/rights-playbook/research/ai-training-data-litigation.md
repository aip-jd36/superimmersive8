# Research: AI Training Data Lawsuits & Tool Liability

**Status:** Complete (February 2026)

## Bottom Line for SI8

**User liability is real.** Both the tool company AND the user/filmmaker can be held liable for infringing outputs. This must be reflected in the Filmmaker Agreement warranties and the Safe Lane policy.

**Tool choice matters.** Adobe Firefly is the only tool with documented licensed training data and no active litigation. Midjourney and Stability AI carry known exposure. Sora 2, Kling, Veo, and Pika are untested but likely future targets.

## Tool Risk Tiers (February 2026)

| Tier | Tools | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Tier 1 — Demonstrably Safe** | Adobe Firefly | Trained on Adobe Stock + licensed content + public domain only. No lawsuits. Explicitly safe for commercial use. |
| **Tier 2 — Contested, Proceeding** | OpenAI (DALL-E, ChatGPT) | Not directly sued yet. Sora 2 opt-out controversy (Oct 2025) suggests known IP risk. |
| **Tier 3 — Active Litigation** | Midjourney, Stability AI | Under active suit. Discovery ongoing. No final rulings yet. High-risk for commercial use. |
| **Tier 3 — Immediate Legal Pushback** | Sora 2 (OpenAI video) | CAA and MPA formal opposition (Sept-Oct 2025). Lawsuits likely in 2026. |
| **Tier 4 — Untested** | Kling, Veo, Pika, Hailuo/Minimax | No public litigation yet, but studios are suing broadly. Hailuo (MiniMax) just sued by Disney/Warner Bros. (Nov 2025). Kling and Veo likely next. |

## Key Cases (2024–2025)

### Getty Images v. Stability AI (UK)
- **Outcome (Nov 2025):** Stability AI largely won on UK copyright claims
- **Why:** Training occurred outside the UK; court ruled "AI model weights are not a copy" of training images under UK law
- **Important caveat:** UK ruling does NOT apply to US courts. US lawsuits on US-based training are still active.

### Andersen v. Stability AI (US, Class Action)
- **Status:** Active — in discovery as of Feb 2026
- **Ruling (Aug 2024):** Judge denied motion to dismiss. Direct and induced copyright infringement claims found "plausible."
- **Discovery deadline:** Feb 2026

### Thomson Reuters v. Ross Intelligence (Feb 2025)
- **Outcome:** Using copyrighted data to train AI is NOT fair use — direct copyright infringement found.

### Bartz v. Anthropic (June 2025)
- **Outcome:** IS fair use for Anthropic to copy books to train Claude
- **Settlement:** $1.5 billion (largest AI training data settlement to date)
- **Note:** Directly contradicts Thomson Reuters ruling — courts are inconsistent. Fair use is unsettled.

### Disney/Universal v. Midjourney (June 2025)
- Discovery deadline: Aug 2026

### Warner Bros. v. Midjourney (Sept 2025)
- Active litigation

### Disney/Warner Bros. v. MiniMax/Hailuo (Nov 2025)
- Video generation specifically — directly relevant to SI8 filmmakers using Hailuo

## User Liability — Critical Finding

**Users are NOT automatically shielded by using a tool.**

Current law allows both the user AND the tool company to be held liable:
- A user who prompts an AI tool to generate infringing content could be **directly liable** under copyright law — even without knowing the output infringes
- If AI output resembles existing IP (characters, scenes, styles), both user and tool company face exposure

**Implication for SI8:** The Filmmaker Agreement must include:
1. Warranty that filmmaker used tools in compliance with their ToS
2. Warranty that output does not knowingly infringe existing IP
3. Indemnification clause protecting SI8 from filmmaker's tool choices

## Critical Dates Ahead

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Feb 2026 | Discovery deadline — consolidated litigation |
| March 2026 | UK Government AI copyright report (may signal legislation) |
| Summer 2026 | Expected fair use ruling on training data — could be decisive |
| Aug 2026 | Disney/Universal v. Midjourney expert discovery deadline |

## SI8 Policy Implications

**Add to Safe Lane / No List:**
- ❌ No work produced primarily with tools in Tier 3 (Midjourney, Stability AI) for commercial licensing without additional review
- ⚠️ Sora 2 and Hailuo — monitor closely; advise filmmakers of current exposure
- ✅ Adobe Firefly — safest for commercial work; encourage use where possible

**Add to Filmmaker Agreement warranties:**
- Filmmaker must disclose which AI tools were used
- Filmmaker warrants tools were used in compliance with their ToS
- Filmmaker warrants output does not knowingly replicate existing copyrighted characters, scenes, or IP
- Indemnification: filmmaker covers SI8 for claims arising from their tool choices

**Add to Rights Playbook:**
- Tool tier table (above) — update quarterly as litigation develops
- Advise filmmakers to document their creative process (proves human authorship)
- Advise against using Midjourney/Stability AI for commercially licensed work until litigation resolves
