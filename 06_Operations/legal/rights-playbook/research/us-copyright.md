## Bottom Line for SI8

Works created with **human direction and AI assistance ARE copyrightable** — if a human has exercised meaningful creative control beyond just entering prompts. This is SI8's positioning for all represented work: "AI-assisted, human-directed."

Works generated **solely by AI prompts are NOT copyrightable** under current US law.

## 1. Can AI-Generated Content Be Copyrighted?

**No — if purely AI-generated.**

"Human authorship is a bedrock of copyrightability." The Copyright Office has made clear that copyright protects only material that is the product of human creativity. The term "author" explicitly excludes non-humans.

**Yes — if sufficiently human-directed.**

The use of AI tools to *assist* rather than *stand in for* human creativity does NOT bar copyrightability. This is the critical distinction SI8 relies on.

## 2. What Human Input Is Required?

**Prompts alone are NOT sufficient** — even detailed, iterative prompts do not constitute human authorship.

**Sufficient human involvement includes:**
- Modifying AI-generated material to the degree that modifications meet copyright standards
- Making creative selections or arrangements of AI-generated content
- Integrating human-created elements with AI-generated elements
- Post-generation editing that meaningfully alters the creative expression
- Creative direction over the final expressive elements of the work

## 3. The Zarya of the Dawn Case (Leading Precedent)

**Decision date:** February 21, 2023
**Still the leading case as of February 2026 — no major appellate decisions have overturned it.**

**What was protected:**
- Original human-authored text ✅
- Selection and arrangement of text + images ✅

**What was NOT protected:**
- Individual AI-generated images ❌

**Rationale:** The Copyright Office found too much "distance" between the user's prompts and Midjourney's output — likened to hiring a visual artist whose work the patron cannot claim as their own.

**Significance for SI8:** Even iterative prompting (refining images until satisfied) is not sufficient authorship for the images themselves. But a broader work combining human text + curated AI visuals + creative arrangement can be copyrightable.

## 4. Key Copyright Office Reports (Timeline)

| Date | Development |
|------|-------------|
| March 2023 | Policy statement on AI registration — disclosure requirements codified (88 FR 16194) |
| August 2023 | Notice of Inquiry on AI copyright — 10,000+ public comments received |
| July 2024 | Part 1 of AI Report — addressed digital replicas and deepfakes |
| **January 29, 2025** | **Part 2 of AI Report — comprehensive guidance on copyrightability of AI outputs (most current)** |
| May 2025 | Part 3 (pre-publication) — addressed training AI on copyrighted works |

**January 2025 Report confirms:**
- Works entirely generated by AI: not copyrightable
- "Mere selection of prompts" insufficient even with significant human effort
- AI-assisted works ARE copyrightable when human creativity determines sufficient expressive elements

## 5. Registration Requirements for SI8's Represented Works

When registering (or advising filmmakers on registration):

- **Disclose all AI-generated content** in the registration application (mandatory)
- **Describe the human author's specific contributions** briefly
- For visual works: claim "Selection, coordination, and arrangement" of specified content
- Claim only portions that are human-authored

---

## 6. Practical Stance for SI8

Position all represented work as **"AI-assisted, human-directed"** — not pure AI output.

For filmmaker warranties in the agreement: filmmaker should confirm they exercised meaningful creative control (direction, selection, arrangement, editing) — not just prompt entry.
