**Status:** Complete (February 2026)

## Bottom Line for SI8

YouTube and TikTok have **strict, actively enforced** AI disclosure requirements with real penalties. iQIYI is actively embracing AI content. Viu has no public policy — direct contact required. MyVideo policy must be confirmed with Jamie Lin.

SI8's proactive disclosure policy (label all AI content) is the correct default and already positions ahead of enforcement trends.

## YouTube

**Disclosure required:** Yes — mandatory as of May 21, 2025

**When disclosure IS required:**
- Synthetic or cloned voices resembling real people
- Digitally manipulated visuals depicting a person saying/doing something they never did
- Fabricated real-world events (fake news, simulated disasters)
- Any content that "could reasonably be mistaken for reality"

**When disclosure is NOT required:**
- Clearly unrealistic content (animation, sci-fi effects)
- AI used for production assistance only (scriptwriting, editing, audio cleanup, color correction)
- Special effects clearly not meant to be realistic

**How to disclose:** YouTube Studio → Details → Enable "Altered or synthetic content" toggle

**Penalties for non-disclosure:**
- Demonetization
- Reduced distribution / limited ads
- Contextual warning labels on watch page
- Content removal (deepfakes, fake news, fabricated crime)
- Removal from YouTube Partner Program

**Additional (July 15, 2025):** Stricter monetization requirements for mass-produced AI content — must be "significantly original and authentic."

**SI8 implication:** AI shorts submitted to YouTube genre channels (DUST, Alter, Omeleto) require disclosure toggle. All represented content should be disclosed by default.

## TikTok

**Disclosure required:** Yes — mandatory labeling

**When labeling IS required:**
- AI-generated realistic human faces
- AI voice cloning / synthetic audio
- Photorealistic AI-generated scenes
- Any content viewers might reasonably think is real footage

**When labeling is NOT required:**
- Obviously cartoony AI edits
- AI-generated captions
- Background music from AI tools (if obviously synthetic)

**Auto-labeling:** TikTok may automatically apply "AI-generated" label. Once auto-labeled, creators CANNOT remove it.

**Enforcement (2025 data):**
- 340% increase in removal rates vs. 2024
- 51,618 synthetic media videos removed in H2 2025 alone
- 8,600 accounts permanently banned for AI violations

**Penalty escalation:**
1. 1st offense: Content removal + strike
2. 2nd offense: 7-day posting restriction
3. 3rd offense: 30-day account restriction
4. 4th offense: Permanent monetization ban
5. 5th offense: Account termination

**Detection:** Partnership with C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) — reads Content Credentials from Adobe Firefly, DALL-E, Microsoft Designer automatically.

**SI8 implication:** Filmmakers distributing via TikTok must label proactively or risk auto-detection. SI8's disclosure policy protects against this.

## iQIYI International

**Formal AI policy:** None published — no restrictions found

**Actual stance:** iQIYI is actively embracing AI as a production and content tool:
- Launched "Peter Pau × iQIYI AI Theater" — global creator initiative for AI-driven films (early 2026 premieres)
- 15 AI projects selected for official production
- AIGC used internally: character sketches reduced from 2 weeks to 1 day
- AI presented as a production asset, not a risk

**Key distinction:** iQIYI positions as a platform that uses and welcomes AI content — not a platform with AI content restrictions.

**SI8 implication:** iQIYI is a potentially receptive distribution partner. No disclosure barriers identified. Direct partnership conversation worth pursuing.

---

## Viu

**Formal AI policy:** None found publicly

Viu operates in 16+ markets (Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong, etc.). No published AI content policy as of early 2026. Recently bundled with HBO Max for certain regions (Q4 2025).

**SI8 implication:** Policy unknown — must confirm directly with Viu content partnership team before any submission.

---

## MyVideo (Taiwan Mobile)

**Formal AI policy:** Unknown — **must ask Jamie Lin directly**

**Question to ask on proposal call:**
> "What does MyVideo currently require for AI-generated content submissions — any disclosure requirements, format specifications, or content restrictions?"

---

## Festival Submissions (General)

- AI disclosure increasingly required or expected
- SI8 policy: disclose proactively on all submissions
- Confirm per individual festival submission
