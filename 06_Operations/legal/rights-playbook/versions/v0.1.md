# AI Video Rights Playbook
## SuperImmersive 8 — Internal Reference

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** Working document — not legal advice. For legal guidance, consult qualified counsel.
**Next review:** May 2026 (or sooner if major ruling/platform change)

SI8 positions itself as the trusted operator at the intersection of AI creators, rights, and commercial deployment. This playbook documents the principles and guardrails that make that positioning credible. It is a living document — updated as law, platform policy, and case precedent evolve.

---

## Part 1 — The SI8 Safe Lane

These are SI8's standing rules for all represented content and production work. They protect filmmakers, clients, and SI8 from the areas of highest legal risk.

**SI8 will work with content that is:**
- Created by a human filmmaker who exercised meaningful creative direction — not just prompt entry
- Produced using AI tools on commercially licensed paid plans
- Fully disclosed as AI-generated or AI-assisted on all submissions and platforms
- Free of real-person likenesses, voices, or identities without documented consent

**SI8 will not work with content that:**
- Uses celebrity or real-person likeness without explicit, documented consent
- Clones the voice of a real person without consent
- Imitates copyrighted characters, brands, or IP without licensed authorization
- Is designed to deceive viewers into thinking it is real footage of real events
- Contains political persuasion content
- Was produced primarily using Veo (consumer tier) — commercial use is prohibited by Google's terms
- Was produced primarily using Midjourney or Stability AI for commercial licensing — active studio litigation
- Was produced without a signed project brief (production work only)

**Why this matters to buyers:**
Every project SI8 represents or produces comes with a documented rights position. We have done the legal homework so you do not have to.

## Part 2 — Legal Landscape (Current State)

### Copyright Ownership

**The core principle — consistent across US, Taiwan, and Singapore:**
Human authorship is required for copyright protection. AI-generated content produced solely through prompt entry is not protectable. "AI-assisted, human-directed" work — where a human exercises meaningful creative control over direction, selection, editing, and final expression — is protectable.

**What this means for SI8 filmmakers:**
- Document your creative process: prompts used, iteration decisions, editorial choices, post-generation editing
- "Human-directed" means more than typing a prompt. It means making creative decisions that shape the final output.
- The US Copyright Office (January 2025 report) explicitly validates AI-assisted work as copyrightable when human creativity determines sufficient expressive elements
- Taiwan's TIPO (June 2023) and Singapore's IPOS (2025) take the same position

**SI8's standard framing for all represented work:** *"AI-assisted, human-directed"* — not "AI-generated."

### Training Data & Tool Liability

Not all AI tools carry equal risk. Courts are actively litigating whether training AI models on copyrighted content constitutes infringement, and outcomes have been inconsistent.

**User liability is real.** Both the tool company and the user can be held liable for infringing outputs. Using a well-known tool does not shield a filmmaker from claims.

**Tool risk tiers (February 2026):**

| Risk | Tools |
|------|-------|
| ✅ Recommended | Adobe Firefly, Runway (paid), Pika |
| ⚠️ Monitor | Sora (paid) — best IP terms, but legal pushback building |
| ⚠️ Caution for exclusivity | Kling — retains permanent sublicensable license to use outputs for AI training |
| ❌ Commercial use prohibited | Veo (consumer/Gemini tier) |
| ❌ Active studio litigation | Hailuo/Minimax (sued by Disney/WB, Nov 2025), Midjourney, Stability AI |

SI8 requires all filmmakers to disclose which tools were used and confirm they were on a paid commercial plan at time of production.

### Likeness, Voice & Identity

Using real people's faces, voices, or identities in AI-generated content without consent creates liability under publicity rights laws in most jurisdictions, and under emerging AI-specific legislation in several US states (California, New York, Tennessee).

**SI8 policy:** Synthetic, fictional faces and voices only. No lookalikes of real people. No voice cloning of real individuals. This is a hard line with no exceptions.

### Disclosure Requirements

No universal global law mandates AI disclosure as of early 2026. However, major platforms enforce it independently, and SI8 treats proactive disclosure as standard policy regardless.

**Rationale:** Proactive disclosure is brand-positioning for SI8 — it signals transparency and positions ahead of disclosure requirements that are likely to become mandatory across more jurisdictions and platforms.
