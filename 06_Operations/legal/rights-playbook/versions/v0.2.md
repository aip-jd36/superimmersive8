SI8 positions itself as the trusted operator at the intersection of AI creators, rights, and commercial deployment. This playbook documents the principles and guardrails that make that positioning credible. It is a living document — updated as law, platform policy, and case precedent evolve.

---

## Part 1 — The SI8 Rights Verified

These are SI8's standing rules for all represented content and production work. They protect filmmakers, clients, and SI8 from the areas of highest legal risk.

**SI8 will work with content that is:**
- Created by a human filmmaker who exercised meaningful creative direction — not just prompt entry
- Documented with a human authorship declaration (150+ words detailing editorial choices, iteration decisions, post-generation modifications)
- Produced using AI tools on commercially licensed paid plans
- Fully disclosed as AI-generated or AI-assisted on all submissions and platforms
- Free of real-person likenesses, voices, or identities without documented consent
- Preserves copyright management information (CMI) — no watermark/attribution stripping

**SI8 will not work with content that:**
- Uses celebrity or real-person likeness without explicit, documented consent
- Clones the voice of a real person without consent
- Imitates copyrighted characters, brands, or IP without licensed authorization
- Strips watermarks, signatures, or attribution metadata (DMCA § 1202 violation)
- Is designed to deceive viewers into thinking it is real footage of real events
- Contains political persuasion content
- Was produced primarily using Veo (consumer tier) — commercial use is prohibited by Google's terms
- Was produced primarily using Midjourney or Stability AI for commercial licensing — active studio litigation
- Was produced without a signed project brief (production work only)
- Lacks documented human authorship (prompts alone ≠ copyrightability per USCO Jan 2025)

**Why this matters to buyers:**
Every project SI8 represents or produces comes with a documented rights position. We have done the legal homework so you do not have to.

---

## Part 2 — Legal Landscape (Current State)

### Copyright Ownership & Copyrightability

**The core principle — consistent across US, Taiwan, and Singapore:**
Human authorship is required for copyright protection. AI-generated content produced solely through prompt entry is not protectable. "AI-assisted, human-directed" work — where a human exercises meaningful creative control over direction, selection, editing, and final expression — is protectable.

**NEW: US Copyright Office Part 2 Report (January 2025):**
> "Given current generally available technology, prompts alone do not provide sufficient human control to make users of an AI system the authors of the output... However, [in cases of substantial modification or expressive input] the human's own creative expression will be protected by copyright."

**What this means for SI8 filmmakers:**
- **Human Authorship Declaration required:** 150+ words minimum documenting prompts used, iteration decisions, editorial choices, post-generation editing
- "Human-directed" means more than typing a prompt. It means making creative decisions that shape the final output.
- Without documented human authorship, **brands cannot own the copyright** to AI-generated commercials
- The US Copyright Office (January 2025 report) explicitly validates AI-assisted work as copyrightable when human creativity determines sufficient expressive elements
- Taiwan's TIPO (June 2023) and Singapore's IPOS (2025) take the same position

**SI8's standard framing for all represented work:** *"AI-assisted, human-directed"* — not "AI-generated."

### Damage Mitigation & Statutory Damages

**NEW: Innocent Infringer Defense (17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2))**

Documentation reduces legal exposure through the statutory damages framework:

| Infringement Type | Minimum Damages | Maximum Damages |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Standard | $750 per work | $30,000 per work |
| **Innocent Infringer** | **$200 per work** | **$750 per work** |
| Willful | $30,000 per work | $150,000 per work |

**Quantifiable impact:** 73% damage reduction at minimum ($750 → $200)

**Requirements to qualify:**
- Infringer "was not aware and had no reason to believe" acts constituted infringement
- **"Considerable effort must go into establishing lack of willful disregard, often requiring detailed documentation and compelling argumentation"** (Copyright Alliance)

**How SI8's Chain of Title supports this defense:**
- Field #1 (Tool Provenance Log) = documented compliance
- Field #3 (Rights Verified Sign-off) = compelling argumentation
- Field #4 (Commercial Use Authorization) = good-faith reliance
- Field #9 (Version History) = audit trail

**Critical limitation:** Documentation reduces damages; it does NOT prevent liability if infringement is real.

---

### Regulatory Compliance Requirements (2025-2026)

#### **NEW: Colorado AI Act — "Rebuttable Presumption" Safe Harbor**

**Source:** Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act (SB24-205)
**Effective:** 2026
**Key provision:**

> "Developers and deployers maintain a **rebuttable presumption of using reasonable care** under this provision if they satisfy the obligations of the Act... [including] documentation describing how the system was evaluated... and data governance measures."

**What this means for SI8:**
- SI8's Chain of Title = statutory compliance documentation
- Field #2 (Model Disclosure) + Field #6 (Category Conflict Log) satisfy "reasonable care" standard
- **Avoids state Attorney General civil penalties of up to $20,000 per violation**

---

#### **NEW: EU AI Act Article 50 — Transparency Obligations**

**Source:** Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, Article 50
**Effective:** Phased implementation 2026+
**Requirements:**

Transparency obligations for synthetic/deepfake content and generated content (with specific scopes and exceptions)

**SI8 compliance:**
- Field #2 (Model Disclosure) satisfies EU transparency requirements
- Field #9 (Version History) provides audit trail
- Platform-compliant delivery checklist supports multi-jurisdiction distribution

---

#### **NEW: FTC "Operation AI Comply" Enforcement**

**Source:** FTC Announcement (September 2024 / 2025 Guidelines)
**Focus:** Prosecuting "deceptive" advertising practices, including undisclosed synthetic generation

**SI8 compliance:**
- Rights Verified Sign-off ensures content conforms to FTC endorsement and native advertising guidelines
- No deepfake testimonials, no misleading synthetic performers

---

#### **NEW: New York Synthetic Performer Disclosure Law**

**Effective:** 2026
**Requirements:** Conspicuous disclosure when "synthetic performers" are used in advertising

**SI8 compliance:**
- Field #3 (Rights Verified Sign-off) flags synthetic performer content
- Field #6 (Category Conflict Log) notes disclosure requirements
- **Avoids fines of $1,000 - $5,000 per violation**

---

### Training Data & Tool Liability

Not all AI tools carry equal risk. Courts are actively litigating whether training AI models on copyrighted content constitutes infringement, and outcomes have been inconsistent.

**User liability is real.** Both the tool company and the user can be held liable for infringing outputs. Using a well-known tool does not shield a filmmaker from claims.

**Tool risk tiers (February 2026):**

| Risk | Tools |
|------|-------|
| ✅ Recommended | Adobe Firefly, Runway (paid), Pika |
| ⚠️ Monitor | Sora (paid) — best IP terms, but legal pushback building |
| ⚠️ Caution for exclusivity | Kling — retains permanent sublicensable license to use outputs for AI training |
| ❌ Commercial use prohibited | Veo (consumer/Gemini tier) |
| ❌ Active studio litigation | Hailuo/Minimax (sued by Disney/WB, Nov 2025), Midjourney, Stability AI |

SI8 requires all filmmakers to disclose which tools were used and confirm they were on a paid commercial plan at time of production.

---

### **NEW: DMCA Copyright Management Information (CMI) Preservation**

**Source:** 17 U.S.C. § 1202 (CMI prohibition) & § 1203 (civil remedies)

**Requirements:**
- Prohibits removal/alteration of CMI (watermarks, signatures, attribution metadata)
- Separate violation from copyright infringement itself
- Statutory damages available for CMI violations

**SI8 policy:**
- No watermark stripping
- No signature removal
- Attribution metadata preserved where present
- Field #9 (Version History) documents CMI handling

**Case reference:** Andersen v. Stability AI — CMI preservation claims survived motion to dismiss where outputs contained watermarks/signatures

---

### Likeness, Voice & Identity

Using real people's faces, voices, or identities in AI-generated content without consent creates liability under publicity rights laws in most jurisdictions, and under emerging AI-specific legislation in several US states (California, New York, Tennessee).

**SI8 policy:** Synthetic, fictional faces and voices only. No lookalikes of real people. No voice cloning of real individuals. This is a hard line with no exceptions.

---

### Disclosure Requirements

No universal global law mandates AI disclosure as of early 2026. However, major platforms enforce it independently, and SI8 treats proactive disclosure as standard policy regardless.

**Rationale:** Proactive disclosure is brand-positioning for SI8 — it signals transparency and positions ahead of disclosure requirements that are likely to become mandatory across more jurisdictions and platforms.

---

## Part 3 — Platform & Tool Quick Reference

### Platform Disclosure Policy

| Platform | AI Disclosure Required? | Enforcement | SI8 Action |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|------------|
| YouTube | Yes — realistic AI content (May 2025) | Demonetization, removal, ban | Always enable disclosure toggle |
| TikTok | Yes — realistic faces, voices, scenes | Escalating bans; 340% removal increase in 2025 | Label proactively; C2PA auto-detection active |
| iQIYI | No restrictions found | None identified | Active distribution opportunity — pursue |
| Viu | No public policy | Unknown | Confirm directly before submission |
| MyVideo | Unknown | Unknown | Confirm with Taiwan Mobile contact |
| Festivals | Varies | Disqualification | Confirm per submission |

### Tool Commercial Use Summary

| Tool | Commercial Use | Key Caveat |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Adobe Firefly | ✅ Yes (paid) | Safest — licensed training data |
| Runway | ✅ Yes (paid plans) | Standard service improvement clause |
| Pika | ✅ Yes (all plans) | Standard service improvement clause |
| Sora | ✅ Yes (paid) | Disney/Marvel/Pixar characters licensed; others opt-in only |
| Kling | ✅ Yes (paid) | ⚠️ Sublicensable training data clause — flag for exclusivity deals |
| Veo (consumer) | ❌ Prohibited | Pre-GA status — commercial use requires written Google permission |
| Veo (enterprise) | ✅ Yes | Vertex AI / Google Cloud enterprise accounts only |
| Hailuo/Minimax | ✅ Yes (paid) | ⚠️ Active Disney/WB lawsuit (Nov 2025) for video generation |

## **NEW: Part 4 — Competitive Landscape**

### Adobe Firefly Indemnification (Limitations)

**Source:** Adobe Firefly Legal FAQs / Enterprise Terms (PSLT 2026v1)

**What Adobe indemnifies:**
- Outputs generated entirely within Firefly features
- Adobe Stock-trained models only

**What Adobe explicitly excludes:**

> "Adobe will have no liability for any Claim to the extent that the Claim is based on or arises from: (A) any modification of a Firefly Output... (B) any combination of a Firefly Output with any other material..."

**Critical gap Adobe cannot fill:**
- Adobe indemnifies Firefly only
- Adobe does NOT indemnify Runway, Sora, Midjourney, or Kling outputs
- Creative teams want best tools (Sora/Runway/Kling), not just safe tools (Firefly)

**SI8's differentiation:**
"Adobe = safe but boring (Firefly only). SI8 = best creative AI tools (Sora/Kling/Runway) made safe through Rights Verified vetting."

---

### C2PA vs. SI8 — Provenance vs. Legal Safety

**Source:** C2PA Content Credentials Specification Explainer

**What C2PA does:**
- Cryptographically bound metadata showing how a file was made
- Proves provenance (WHERE content came from)

**What C2PA does NOT do:**

> "It is important to highlight that Content Credentials do not provide value judgments about whether a given set of provenance data is 'true'... or good or bad."

**SI8's differentiation:**
- **C2PA proves the video came from Runway** (provenance metadata)
- **SI8 proves the video won't get you sued by Disney** (legal safety assessment)
- **C2PA is the receipt; SI8 is the legal audit**

**SI8's moat:** C2PA commoditizes provenance documentation. SI8's subjective legal review (Rights Verified vetting, IP assessment, training data risk judgment) cannot be automated.

---

## **NEW: Part 5 — Quantifiable Legal Metrics**

### Damage Reduction
- **73% minimum statutory damage reduction** ($750 → $200 via innocent infringer defense)
- **Up to 99% maximum damage reduction** (avoiding $150,000 willful penalty)

### Regulatory Penalties Avoided
- **Colorado AI Act:** Up to $20,000 per violation (documentation safe harbor)
- **New York Synthetic Performer Law:** $1,000 - $5,000 per violation (disclosure compliance)

### Distribution Enablement
- **E&O insurance:** Documentation = chain-of-title equivalent (hypothesis — validate with broker)
- **Platform compliance:** Avoids demonetization, removal, account bans

### Copyrightability Protection
- **USCO requirement:** Human authorship declaration required for copyright ownership
- **Without documentation:** Brand cannot own copyright to AI-generated commercial
