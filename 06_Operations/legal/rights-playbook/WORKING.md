# Rights Playbook — Working Doc

**Status:** In progress
**Current version:** Pre-v0.1 (research complete, draft ready to write)
**Next version trigger:** Good enough for filmmaker call + MyVideo proposal

This is the scratchpad. Messy is fine. All research notes, questions, half-thoughts, and drafts go here before they graduate to a clean version.

## Key Findings Synthesis (for v0.1 draft)

### Copyright — consistent across all jurisdictions
US, Taiwan, and Singapore all require human authorship. Prompts alone are insufficient everywhere.
"AI-assisted, human-directed" is the correct and legally validated framing in all three jurisdictions.
Filmmakers must document their creative process (prompts, iterations, editorial decisions).

### Tool risk tiers

| Tier | Tools | Recommendation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| ✅ Safest | Adobe Firefly | Licensed training data, no litigation |
| ✅ Recommended | Runway (paid), Pika | Clear commercial terms, no active suits |
| ⚠️ Monitor | Sora (paid) | Best IP terms but legal pushback building |
| ⚠️ Caution | Kling (paid) | Popular in Asia, aggressive training data clause — avoid for exclusive deals |
| ❌ Avoid | Veo consumer | Commercial use prohibited even on paid plans |
| ❌ High risk | Hailuo/Minimax | Active Disney/WB lawsuit Nov 2025 specifically for video generation |
| ❌ Avoid | Midjourney, Stability AI | Active studio litigation |

### Platform disclosure — mandatory on key platforms
- YouTube: Mandatory for realistic AI content (May 2025). Penalties: demonetization, removal, ban.
- TikTok: Mandatory labeling. 340% increase in removals in 2025. C2PA auto-detection active.
- iQIYI: No restrictions — actively running AI film program. Potential distribution partner.
- Viu: No public policy — must confirm directly.
- MyVideo: Unknown — ask Jamie Lin.

### User liability is real
Both tool companies AND users can be held liable for infringing outputs.
Filmmakers are not shielded by using a well-known tool. Must be in the Filmmaker Agreement.

### Kling training data clause
Kling retains a permanent, sublicensable license to use outputs for training future models.
This complicates exclusive licensing deals. Flag any Kling-generated content before negotiating exclusivity.

### iQIYI is a distribution opportunity
They launched "Peter Pau × iQIYI AI Theater" (early 2026). Actively seeking AI film content.
No disclosure requirements or restrictions found. Add to distribution channel outreach list.

## Open Questions (remaining)

- What does MyVideo currently require for AI-generated content? (Ask Jamie Lin)
- What tools is the Taipei filmmaker using? Are they on paid plans?
- Viu policy — direct contact needed before any submission
- Taiwan Copyright Bureau comprehensive guidelines — no release date, check quarterly
