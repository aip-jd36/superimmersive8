# Filmmaker Agreement — Working Doc

**Status:** In progress
**Current version:** Pre-v0.1 (interim memo stage)
**Next version trigger:** Ready for filmmaker call (post-Lunar New Year)

---

## Immediate Need: Interim Memo (v0.1)

Before the formal agreement is drafted by a lawyer, a 1-page non-binding memo
allows early conversations to proceed without legal delay.

**Memo purpose:** Signal intent, establish non-exclusive relationship, buy time
for formal agreement to be drafted.

**Memo should cover:**
- Non-exclusive representation on an exploratory basis
- No binding commitment created
- SI8's role: submit work, negotiate licenses, market filmmaker
- Filmmaker retains all rights during this period
- Either party can exit at any time before formal agreement is signed

## Formal Agreement — Key Terms to Finalize

*(Use this to brief the lawyer)*

### Scope
- Which works: [ ] All AI films  [ ] Specific titles  [ ] Filmmaker's choice
- Decision: Start with "filmmaker's choice" — lower barrier to sign

### Exclusivity
- Decision: Non-exclusive to start
- Reason: Reduces friction for initial signings

### Territory
- Decision: APAC + Europe initially; global optional add-on
- Open question: Does filmmaker want Taiwan-only? Global? Discuss on call.

### Duration
- Proposed: 12 months, auto-renews unless either party gives 30 days notice

### Commission
- SI8: 20% of deals brokered
- Filmmaker: 80%
- Payment: SI8 pays filmmaker within 30 days of receiving payment from buyer

### What SI8 Can Do
- Submit to festivals
- Negotiate licenses with platforms, brands, educational institutions
- Use work in SI8 marketing (with filmmaker approval)
- Include in MyVideo / platform proposals

### What Filmmaker Retains
- Final approval on any exclusive licensing deals
- Right to self-distribute work not covered by active SI8 negotiations
- All IP ownership

### AI-Specific Warranties (Filmmaker must confirm)
- [ ] Used AI tools in compliance with those tools' terms of service
- [ ] Was on a paid plan for all tools used at time of production (free tiers often exclude commercial use)
- [ ] No unauthorized real-person likeness or voice cloning used
- [ ] Content does not infringe known copyrighted characters, scenes, or IP to filmmaker's knowledge
- [ ] Will disclose all AI tools used in production
- [ ] **[NEW] Provides Human Authorship Declaration (150+ words minimum)** documenting:
  - Prompts used and creative intent
  - Iteration decisions and selection process
  - Editorial choices and post-generation modifications
  - Meaningful creative control exercised beyond prompt entry
  - **Required for copyright protection** per U.S. Copyright Office Part 2 Report (Jan 2025), Taiwan TIPO, and Singapore IPOS
- [ ] **[NEW] Preserves Copyright Management Information (CMI)**:
  - No removal or alteration of watermarks, signatures, or attribution metadata
  - Preserves provenance information where present in AI tool outputs
  - **Required under DMCA § 1202** — separate violation from copyright infringement
  - Filmmaker acknowledges that CMI stripping creates statutory damages exposure under 17 U.S.C. § 1203
- [ ] Acknowledges that Veo consumer outputs are commercially prohibited and cannot be submitted
- [ ] Acknowledges that Kling-generated content may complicate exclusive licensing agreements (Kling retains sublicensable training data rights)

### Indemnification
- Filmmaker covers SI8 if a claim arises from their content
- Standard mutual indemnification language

### Termination
- Either party: 30 days written notice
- Deals already in active negotiation survive termination for 90 days

**Why these new requirements matter (February 2026 legal research):**

*Human Authorship Declaration:*
- U.S. Copyright Office (Jan 2025): "Prompts alone do not provide sufficient human control to make users of an AI system the authors of the output"
- Without documented human authorship, **brands cannot own copyright** to AI-generated commercials
- SI8 needs this to prove copyrightability to buyers (premium distribution requirement)
- 150 words minimum documents "meaningful creative control" courts require

*CMI Preservation:*
- DMCA § 1202/1203 prohibits removal/alteration of copyright management information (watermarks, signatures, attribution)
- Separate violation from infringement — statutory damages available
- Andersen v. Stability AI (2024-2026): CMI preservation claims survived motion to dismiss
- SI8's Rights Verified process includes CMI compliance — filmmakers must not strip metadata before submission

- Any concerns about the 20% commission?
- What works does he want to include — all films, or specific titles?
