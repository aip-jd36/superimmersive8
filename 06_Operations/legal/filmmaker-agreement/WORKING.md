# Filmmaker Agreement — Working Doc

**Status:** In progress
**Current version:** Pre-v0.1 (interim memo stage)
**Next version trigger:** Ready for filmmaker call (post-Lunar New Year)

---

## Immediate Need: Interim Memo (v0.1)

Before the formal agreement is drafted by a lawyer, a 1-page non-binding memo
allows early conversations to proceed without legal delay.

**Memo purpose:** Signal intent, establish non-exclusive relationship, buy time
for formal agreement to be drafted.

**Memo should cover:**
- Non-exclusive representation on an exploratory basis
- No binding commitment created
- SI8's role: submit work, negotiate licenses, market filmmaker
- Filmmaker retains all rights during this period
- Either party can exit at any time before formal agreement is signed

*(Use this to brief the lawyer)*

### Scope
- Which works: [ ] All AI films  [ ] Specific titles  [ ] Filmmaker's choice
- Decision: Start with "filmmaker's choice" — lower barrier to sign

### Exclusivity
- Decision: Non-exclusive to start
- Reason: Reduces friction for initial signings

### Territory
- Decision: APAC + Europe initially; global optional add-on
- Open question: Does filmmaker want Taiwan-only? Global? Discuss on call.

### AI-Specific Warranties (Filmmaker must confirm)

- [ ] Content does not infringe known copyrighted characters, scenes, or IP to filmmaker's knowledge

## Open Questions for Filmmaker Call

- What tools does he use? (Runway, Kling, Sora, Veo — or others?)
- Does he have existing distribution or licensing in place we'd need to work around?
- Is he comfortable with the MyVideo pilot concept?
- What does he want from representation? (Exposure, income, legal protection, community?)
- Any concerns about the 25% commission?
- What works does he want to include — all films, or specific titles?
