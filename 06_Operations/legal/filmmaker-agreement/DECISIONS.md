# Filmmaker Agreement — Decisions Log

---

## Pre-v0.1 (February 2026)

**Use case this version must serve:**
- Filmmaker call (post-Lunar New Year)
- Non-binding memo to allow relationship to proceed before formal agreement

**Key decisions made:**
- Start with non-exclusive representation (lower barrier to sign)
- 25% commission / 75% filmmaker split
- Territory: APAC + Europe first
- Filmmaker retains all IP
- Interim memo first, formal agreement follows lawyer engagement
- Non-exclusive means filmmaker can self-distribute — we only take commission on deals we broker

**Still to decide:**
- Scope of works (all films vs. specific titles) — discuss with filmmaker
- Territory preference — does he want Taiwan-only or broader?
- Formal agreement language — needs entertainment lawyer (Taiwan + international)

**Lawyer brief status:** Not yet drafted
