## AI-Specific Clauses Needed

Please draft warranty clauses where filmmaker confirms:

1. All AI tools used in production were used in compliance with those tools' terms of service
2. No unauthorized real-person likeness, voice, or identity was used
3. Content does not infringe known copyrights to filmmaker's knowledge
4. Filmmaker will disclose all AI tools used upon SI8's reasonable request
5. Indemnification: filmmaker indemnifies SI8 against claims arising from their content

## Questions for Lawyer

- What jurisdiction is most favorable for enforceability with international filmmakers?
- Should this be a Taiwan-law agreement or international arbitration?
- Are there Taiwan-specific requirements for entertainment representation agreements?
- What's the recommended approach for the AI warranty clauses given current legal uncertainty?
- Is 25% commission standard / enforceable in Taiwan for this type of agreement?

## Additional Issue: Tier 2 Regeneration Copyright Ownership (Flag for Discussion)

**Context:**
SI8's Tier 2 product offering involves AI product placement: SI8 commissions AI-regenerated versions of specific scenes from catalog films, with brand elements integrated, without a reshoot. The filmmaker authorizes this in their submission (and the representation agreement must include a modification clause).

**The unresolved legal question:**
When SI8 prompts AI tools to regenerate Scene 3 of a filmmaker's film to insert a brand element, who authored the regenerated scene?

- The filmmaker's original human authorship declaration covers the original scenes.
- SI8's reviewer did not "author" the regenerated content in any traditional sense.
- The regenerated scenes may have no qualifying human authorship — which could leave them public domain or in ambiguous ownership, complicating the chain of title for the buyer.

**What SI8 needs the agreement to resolve:**

Option A: The agreement stipulates that SI8 acts as the filmmaker's agent/proxy for the regeneration, and the filmmaker formally adopts the regenerated scenes as their own derivative work. This keeps the filmmaker as the rights-holder throughout.

Option B: The agreement clearly assigns ownership of the regenerated scenes to SI8 as a work-for-hire or new independent creation. SI8 then licenses to buyers separately from the original.

Option C: A hybrid — the original work's rights remain with the filmmaker; regenerated brand-integrated versions are a separate SI8-produced derivative work with rights split between SI8 and filmmaker per agreed terms.

**What we need from the lawyer:**
- Which approach is legally cleanest under Taiwan law and APAC commercial practice?
- How does this interact with the buyer's expectation that they are licensing content with a clean chain of title?
- What language in the modification clause resolves this unambiguously?
- Does the answer change if the regeneration is done by a third-party freelancer commissioned by SI8 vs. SI8 directly?
