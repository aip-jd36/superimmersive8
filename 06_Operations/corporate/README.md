## Quick Reference

### Current Structure (Year 1, 2026)

**Primary Entity (US):**
- Legal Entity: PMF Strategy Inc. (Texas S-Corp, 2022)
- Brand Name: SuperImmersive 8 (DBA/Assumed Name)
- Status: DBA to be filed Week of Feb 24, 2026
- Role: Master/HQ (owns IP, catalog, filmmaker agreements)

**Secondary Entity (Taiwan) — Optional:**
- Legal Entity: 沉浸科技顧問有限公司 (Taiwan LLC, 統編: 83067478)
- Role: Local reseller/agent for Taiwan deals (ONLY if buyer requires it)
- Default: Not used unless Taiwan buyer specifically needs Taiwan entity

**Presentation:**
- Public-facing: "SuperImmersive 8" or "SI8"
- Contracts/Legal: "PMF Strategy Inc., a Texas corporation, doing business as SuperImmersive 8 ("SI8")"
- Taiwan deals (if needed): Taiwan LLC acts as reseller via intercompany agreement

### Key Principles

1. **Lead with brand, deliver on legal** — SI8 is the brand; PMF Strategy is the legal entity
2. **Consistency is critical** — Don't mix names inconsistently across documents
3. **Matter-of-fact presentation** — DBA structure is normal; don't apologize for it
4. **Validate before restructuring** — Prove model works before forming separate entity

### Decision Checkpoint

**August 2026 (6-month review):** Evaluate whether to continue DBA or form SI8 LLC/Inc.

**Criteria to consider:**
- Monthly recurring revenue
- Fundraising opportunities
- Buyer feedback on entity structure
- Liability exposure

## Synthesis Note

The `STRUCTURE-OVERVIEW.md` document synthesizes three independent analyses:

1. **Claude analysis** (legal/operational framework, document strategy)
2. **ChatGPT analysis** (entity structure options, contract language)
3. **Gemini analysis** (buyer perception, "Mullet Strategy", procurement reality)

All three analyses independently recommended DBA for Year 1, confirming strategic soundness.
