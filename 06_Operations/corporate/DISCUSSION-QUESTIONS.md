# Corporate Structure — Discussion Questions

**Purpose:** Align on critical operational decisions before filing DBA and executing Year 1 strategy.

**Status:** Draft for discussion (February 23, 2026)

---

## Context Summary

We've synthesized three independent analyses (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) and all agree on the **Master/Node model:**

- **US entity (PMF Strategy Inc.)** = Master/HQ (owns IP, catalog, filmmaker agreements)
- **Taiwan LLC (沉浸科技)** = Optional local node (only if Taiwan buyer requires it)
- **Strategic intent:** SI8 is a global business, not Taiwan-focused

**All three analyses independently confirmed:**
✅ DBA is not a red flag for enterprise buyers
✅ Keep SI8 under US entity for IP consolidation, tax simplicity, global scalability
✅ Taiwan LLC = strategic tool, not default structure

## Critical Questions for Alignment

### 1. MyVideo Entity Preference (Highest Priority)

**The Question:**
Has Jamie Lin (or Taiwan Mobile procurement) indicated any preference for contracting with:
- A) Taiwan entity (沉浸科技顧問有限公司)
- B) US entity (PMF Strategy Inc.)
- C) No preference / unknown

**Why it matters:**
- If MyVideo requires Taiwan entity → Use intercompany reseller model
- If MyVideo OK with US entity → Simpler default structure
- MyVideo is Track 1 (credibility maker), so their preference is high-signal

**Action options:**

**Option A: Ask Jamie Lin directly**
- Contact him this week: "For the MyVideo licensing deal, would Taiwan Mobile prefer contracting with my Taiwan entity or my US entity? Any vendor onboarding preference?"
- **Pro:** Get definitive answer, optimize for Track 1 priority
- **Con:** Adds another step before executing

**Option B: Assume US entity is fine, proceed**
- File US DBA this week
- If MyVideo later needs Taiwan entity, add intercompany agreement
- **Pro:** Don't delay on uncertainty
- **Con:** Might need to restructure if Taiwan entity required

**Which path do you prefer?**

---

### 2. DBA Filing Timeline

**The Question:**
Should we file the Texas DBA for "SuperImmersive 8" this week, or wait for MyVideo entity preference confirmation?

**Option A: File DBA this week**
- Cost: $25
- Time: 10 minutes filing, 1-3 days processing
- Enables immediate contract execution through PMF Strategy d/b/a SI8
- If MyVideo needs Taiwan entity later → add intercompany agreement (doesn't invalidate DBA)

**Option B: Wait for MyVideo confirmation**
- Delays entity setup by 1-2 weeks (or however long until Jamie Lin responds)
- Risks: Can't execute contracts in meantime

**Recommendation:** File DBA this week (doesn't preclude Taiwan LLC use later if needed).

**Your preference?**

### 3. Tax & Accounting Considerations

**The Question:**
Do you need a CPA consultation before finalizing entity structure?

**Key questions for CPA:**
1. **Tax residency:** Are you US tax resident, Taiwan tax resident, or both?
2. **Income attribution:** If SI8 revenue flows through PMF Strategy (US), but you're Taiwan-based, does that create US nexus/presence issues?
3. **Taiwan income:** You mentioned PMF Strategy is pass-through for Taiwan NTD income → how does that work currently?
4. **Intercompany pricing:** If using Taiwan LLC as reseller, what commission/fee is defensible for Taiwan tax authorities?

**Current status:**
- PMF Strategy Inc. = S-Corp (pass-through to personal tax return)
- You're Taipei-based but filing US taxes
- Taiwan LLC generates B2B consulting income

**Is your current CPA familiar with US + Taiwan cross-border tax issues?**

**Action needed?**
- [ ] Yes, schedule CPA consultation before proceeding
- [ ] No, current structure is already validated by CPA
- [ ] Not sure, need to check

### 4. Intercompany Agreement — Draft Now or Wait?

**The Question:**
Should we draft the "Intercompany Reseller & Services Agreement" between PMF Strategy and Taiwan LLC now (proactive), or wait until a Taiwan buyer specifically requires it (reactive)?

**Option A: Draft now (proactive)**
- **Pro:** Ready to activate if MyVideo requires Taiwan entity
- **Pro:** Forces clarity on transfer pricing, commission structure
- **Pro:** Can show Jamie Lin we have local entity ready if needed
- **Con:** Effort investment before we know if it's needed

**Option B: Wait (reactive)**
- **Pro:** Don't build it until we know it's needed
- **Pro:** Might never need it (if all buyers OK with US entity)
- **Con:** Delays deal execution if Taiwan entity required

**Recommendation:** Wait until buyer specifically requires Taiwan entity (don't over-engineer).

**Your preference?**

### 5. Website Footer Update

**The Question:**
After DBA is filed, should website footer show:

**Option A: Legal entity disclosed**
```
© 2026 PMF Strategy Inc. d/b/a SuperImmersive 8. All rights reserved.
```

**Option B: Brand only**
```
© 2026 SuperImmersive 8. All rights reserved.
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Option A = Transparent, professional, matches contract language
- Option B = Cleaner, brand-focused, legal entity only appears in contracts

**Most companies do Option A** (disclose legal entity in fine print).

**Your preference?**

---

### 6. Filmmaker Agreement Entity

**The Question:**
ALL filmmaker shopping agreements should be signed by which entity?

**Recommendation:** PMF Strategy Inc. d/b/a SuperImmersive 8 (regardless of filmmaker location)

**Rationale:**
- Centralizes IP ownership in US entity
- Clean cap table, clean Rights Verified catalog
- Taiwan filmmakers can still be paid in NTD if needed (US entity can wire NTD)
- Avoids split catalog (some works under US entity, some under Taiwan entity)

**Agree?** Or any scenario where Taiwan filmmaker should sign with Taiwan LLC?

---

### 7. Contract Template Priority

**The Question:**
Which contract template should we update first?

**Priority order (recommended):**
1. **Master License Agreement** (buyer-facing) — add signature block: "PMF Strategy Inc., a Texas corporation, doing business as SuperImmersive 8 ("SI8")"
2. **Filmmaker Shopping Agreement** (filmmaker-facing) — same signature block
3. **Invoice Template** — add legal entity line
4. **Rights Verified Package footer/signature** — add PMF Strategy d/b/a SI8

**Timeline:**
- Week 1 (this week): File DBA
- Week 2: Update #1 and #2 (most critical)
- Week 3: Update #3 and #4

**Does this priority order make sense?**

---

### 8. MyVideo Communication Strategy

**The Question:**
When discussing entity structure with Jamie Lin / Taiwan Mobile, what's the messaging?

**Option A: Lead with US entity, offer Taiwan flexibility**
> "SuperImmersive 8 is a US-based rights agency. We have a Taiwan subsidiary (沉浸科技顧問有限公司) if Taiwan Mobile's procurement process prefers working with a local entity. Which would be easier for your team?"

**Option B: Lead with Taiwan entity option**
> "We can contract through our Taiwan entity (沉浸科技顧問有限公司) for easier local invoicing and procurement, or through our US parent company if you prefer global entity."

**Option C: Don't proactively mention entity choice, wait for them to ask**
> Let procurement process surface entity requirements naturally

**Recommendation:** Option A (lead with US, offer Taiwan flexibility if needed).

**Your preference?**

---

### 9. Filmmaker Payout Currency

**The Question:**
What currency should filmmakers be paid in?

**Current plan:**
- 20% royalty (Tier 1) or 50% split (Tier 2)
- Paid from US entity (PMF Strategy)

**For Taiwan-based filmmakers:**
- Pay in USD (international wire to Taiwan bank account)?
- Pay in NTD (US entity can wire NTD if needed)?

**For global filmmakers:**
- USD (standard)

**Does current US bank account support international wires in multiple currencies?**

---

### 10. Six-Month Checkpoint Metrics

**The Question:**
What metrics should we track to evaluate entity structure at August 2026 checkpoint?

**Proposed metrics:**
1. **Revenue by geography** (Taiwan % vs SEA % vs Other)
2. **Entity friction log** (any buyer procurement issues with US entity?)
3. **Taiwan LLC usage** (how many deals required Taiwan entity vs US entity?)
4. **Filmmaker feedback** (any entity-related friction in onboarding?)
5. **Tax complexity** (CPA feedback on cross-border tax filing burden)

**Trigger for change:**
- If >70% revenue from Taiwan AND multiple buyers required Taiwan entity → Consider making Taiwan LLC primary SI8 vehicle
- If <20% revenue from Taiwan AND no procurement friction → Continue US entity as-is
- If revenue >$10K/month → Consider forming standalone SI8 LLC

**Agree with these checkpoint criteria?**

## Summary: What We Need to Decide Now

**High Priority (This Week):**
1. ✅ **File DBA or wait?** → Recommendation: File this week
2. ✅ **Ask Jamie Lin entity preference or assume US OK?** → User decision needed
3. ⚠️ **Need CPA consultation?** → User to confirm current tax structure is solid

**Medium Priority (Next 2 Weeks):**
4. Update contract templates (Master License Agreement, Filmmaker Agreement)
5. Update website footer
6. Confirm filmmaker payout currency approach

**Low Priority (Wait Until Needed):**
7. Draft intercompany agreement (only if Taiwan buyer requires it)
8. Taiwan LLC activation (only if buyer specifically needs it)
