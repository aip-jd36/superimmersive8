## Decision History

### Decision 001 — Year 1 DBA Structure
**Date:** February 22, 2026
**Decision:** File "SuperImmersive 8" as official DBA under PMF Strategy Inc. for Year 1 operations.

**Context:**
- SI8 operated informally as DBA in 2023 (2 deals closed), but never officially filed with Texas SOS
- New business model (v3.0: Rights Agency + AI Product Placement) launching Q1 2026
- Need to formalize legal structure before scaling operations

**Options Considered:**
1. File DBA under PMF Strategy Inc. (SELECTED)
2. Form new LLC for SuperImmersive 8
3. Rebrand entirely under PMF Strategy
4. Create new entity with different name

**Rationale for DBA:**
- Minimal cost ($25 vs $300+ for new LLC)
- Speed (1-3 days vs 2-4 weeks)
- Validate model before committing to separate entity
- PMF Strategy Inc. (2022) shows 3+ years corporate history
- US S-Corp easier for APAC buyer procurement
- Full flexibility to spin out SI8 entity in Year 2 if needed

**Analysis Sources:**
- Claude analysis (legal/operational framework)
- ChatGPT analysis (entity structure options)
- Gemini analysis (buyer perception + procurement reality)
- All three analyses independently recommended DBA for Year 1

**Risk Accepted:**
Liability contamination — If SI8 sued, PMF Strategy Inc. is exposed. Mitigated by: conservative Rights Verified vetting, strong indemnification clauses, low early revenue (<$50K Year 1), future E&O insurance investigation.

**Checkpoint Trigger:**
August 2026 (6-month review) — evaluate revenue, fundraising opportunities, buyer feedback → decide whether to continue DBA or form standalone entity.

**Status:** Decision finalized, filing pending (Week of Feb 24, 2026)

### Decision 002 — Brand vs Legal Name Presentation
**Date:** February 22, 2026
**Decision:** Use "Mullet Strategy" — Creative brand in front (SI8), corporate legal in back (PMF Strategy Inc.)

**Presentation Framework:**

**Public-Facing (Lead with SI8):**
- Website header/navigation
- Marketing materials
- Social media
- Email signatures
- Rights Verified Package cover pages

**Legal/Contract Documents (Full entity name):**
- Contract signature blocks: "PMF Strategy Inc., a Texas corporation, doing business as SuperImmersive 8 ("SI8")"
- Invoices: PMF Strategy Inc. d/b/a SuperImmersive 8
- Bank wire instructions: PMF Strategy Inc. (must match bank account)
- Tax documents: PMF Strategy Inc. EIN

**Both (Brand + Legal):**
- Website footer: "© 2026 PMF Strategy Inc. d/b/a SuperImmersive 8"
- Rights Verified Package footer: "SuperImmersive 8 | PMF Strategy Inc."
- Rights Verified Package signature block: Full legal entity + reviewer name

**Rationale:**
- Buyers see SI8 brand (what they know)
- Legal entity disclosed transparently (professional, enforceable)
- Consistent with industry standard (production companies, agencies routinely operate under DBAs)
- PMF Strategy name actually reinforces SI8's "risk mitigation" value prop (strategy/compliance connotation)

**Related Documents:**
- `STRUCTURE-OVERVIEW.md` (Section: "The Mullet Strategy")

**Status:** Finalized, ready to implement

### Decision 003 — Standard Response: "What's PMF Strategy?"
**Date:** February 22, 2026
**Decision:** Matter-of-fact, confident explanation (don't over-explain or apologize)

**Standard Response (Recommended):**
> "PMF Strategy is our parent company, established in 2022. We operate our AI film rights business under the SuperImmersive 8 brand. It's a standard DBA structure — similar to how many production companies and agencies operate."

**Shorter Alternative:**
> "That's our legal entity. We do business as SuperImmersive 8."

**Principle:** Treat DBA structure as completely normal (because it is). If you're matter-of-fact, buyers won't question it.

**Status:** Approved for use in buyer conversations

### Decision 004 — Taiwan LLC Strategy: Master/Node Model
**Date:** February 23, 2026
**Decision:** Keep SI8 under US entity (PMF Strategy) as master/HQ. Taiwan LLC = optional local reseller/agent for Taiwan-specific deals ONLY if buyer requires it.

**Context:**
- User has existing Taiwan LLC: 沉浸科技顧問有限公司 (統編: 83067478)
- Taiwan LLC currently used for B2B sales consulting
- PMF Strategy Inc. currently <$10K revenue (minimal, pass-through)
- User's strategic intent: "My intention is to be a global business"

**Options Considered:**
1. All SI8 through US entity, ignore Taiwan LLC (SELECTED for default)
2. All SI8 through Taiwan entity
3. Dual structure (territory-based entity selection)
4. Taiwan LLC as subsidiary of US entity

**Rationale for Master/Node Model:**
- **IP consolidation** — All catalog, filmmaker agreements, Rights Verified process centralized in US entity for clean cap table, M&A readiness, global coherence
- **Global licensing standard** — US copyright law universally understood; Taiwan LLC designed for local services, not global IP licensing
- **Tax simplicity** — US S-Corp pass-through simpler than Taiwan corporate tax + cross-border repatriation
- **Filmmaker payouts** — US entity can pay global filmmakers without Taiwan FX controls or 20% withholding tax
- **Liability isolation** — Keep US licensing risk separate from Taiwan consulting risk
- **Future scalability** — VC/acquisition easier with US entity structure

**When to Activate Taiwan LLC:**
- ONLY if Taiwan buyer specifically requires local entity (e.g., MyVideo procurement policy)
- ONLY if local FaPiao invoicing creates significant buyer friction reduction
- Default: Try US entity first, even for Taiwan deals

**Intercompany Structure (If Needed):**
```
PMF Strategy Inc. (Master — owns IP, catalog, filmmaker agreements)
  ↓ Intercompany Reseller Agreement
Taiwan LLC (Agent — local sales, FaPiao invoicing)
  ↓ Sales Contract
Taiwan Buyer
```

**Analysis Sources:**
- Claude: Ask Jamie Lin entity preference first, tax/accounting considerations
- ChatGPT: IP licensing cleaner in US, liability isolation, only use Taiwan LLC if required
- Gemini: FaPiao advantage for Taiwan procurement, but user's global intent overrides

**All three analyses agreed:** Master/Node model (not dual structure) is correct for global business intent.

**Consensus insight from Gemini:**
- "沉浸科技" = "Immersive Tech" (semantic brand match to SI8)
- Taiwan corporate buyers prefer local FaPiao (no 20% withholding tax on foreign payments)
- However, user's global intent means Taiwan LLC is optional tool, not default structure

**Related Documents:**
- `STRUCTURE-OVERVIEW.md` (Section: "Taiwan LLC Strategy: Master/Node Model")
- `INTERCOMPANY-AGREEMENT-FRAMEWORK.md` (if created)

**Open Questions (Requires User Decision):**
1. File US DBA now, or wait for MyVideo entity preference confirmation?
2. Contact Jamie Lin to ask entity preference?
3. Need CPA consultation on US + Taiwan tax residency implications?

**Status:** Decision finalized (Master/Node model), operational questions pending user input

### Decision 005 — Operational Execution: DBA Filing + US Entity Default
**Date:** February 23, 2026
**Decisions Made:**

**Q1: MyVideo Entity Preference**
- **Decision:** Option B — Assume US entity is acceptable, proceed with DBA filing
- **Rationale:** Don't delay entity setup on uncertainty. If MyVideo later requires Taiwan entity, intercompany reseller agreement can be added without invalidating US entity structure.
- **Fallback:** Taiwan LLC framework documented and ready to activate if needed

**Q2: DBA Filing Timeline**
- **Decision:** Option A — File Texas DBA this week
- **Action:** File Form 503 for "SuperImmersive 8" as Assumed Name under PMF Strategy Inc.
- **Timeline:** File by end of Week 1 (Feb 24-28, 2026)
- **Processing:** 1-3 business days from Texas SOS

**Q3: Tax/Accounting Validation**
- **Decision:** Current CPA validates both US and Taiwan entities
- **Status:** CPA already works on both PMF Strategy Inc. and Taiwan LLC annual tax filings
- **Action:** No additional CPA consultation needed before proceeding
- **Note:** CPA familiar with cross-border US + Taiwan tax structure

**Implications:**
- ✅ Clear to proceed with US entity (PMF Strategy d/b/a SI8) as default for ALL contracts
- ✅ Taiwan LLC remains separate (B2B consulting) unless specific buyer requires it
- ✅ Week 1: File DBA
- ✅ Week 2-3: Update contract templates, website footer, invoices
- ✅ Ready to execute filmmaker agreements and licensing deals

**Status:** Approved, execution phase

## Future Decision Points

### FDP-001 — Entity Separation Trigger (August 2026)
**When to decide:** August 2026 (6-month checkpoint)

**Decision criteria:**
- Revenue > $10K/month MRR
- Clear path to $100K+ annual revenue
- Fundraising opportunity emerges
- Significant liability exposure increase
- Buyer feedback indicates entity structure friction

**If YES to 2+ criteria → Consider forming SI8 LLC/Inc.**
**If NO → Continue DBA for Year 2**

**Process if spinning out:**
1. Form SI8 LLC or SI8 Inc. (Texas or Delaware)
2. Transfer IP (trademarks, domain, brand)
3. Assign contracts (filmmakers, buyers, vendors)
4. Novate active deals (1-page assignment agreements)
5. Update all documentation
6. Close Texas DBA

**Cost estimate:** $300-500 formation + $1,500-3,000 legal (contract assignments)
**Timeline:** 30-60 days

**Status:** Pending (review August 2026)

---

### FDP-002 — E&O Insurance Investigation (Q3 2026)
**When to decide:** After first 5-10 licensing deals closed

**Question:** Should SI8 carry Errors & Omissions insurance for media liability?

**Research needed:**
- Are E&O policies available for AI-generated content?
- What do standard media liability policies cover vs exclude for AI?
- Cost at small agency scale (<$100K revenue)?
- Do large brand buyers require proof of E&O insurance?

**Status:** Flagged for future investigation (not Year 1 blocker)

---

### FDP-003 — International Entity Structure (2027+)
**When to decide:** If significant revenue from Taiwan/Singapore markets (>$50K/year from single region)

**Question:** Should SI8 establish local entities in APAC markets?

**Considerations:**
- Taiwan: Easier for MyVideo partnership if local entity exists
- Singapore: Easier for agency partnerships if Singapore-registered
- Tax efficiency (foreign income vs US entity)
- Banking (easier to collect payments from local clients)

**Trade-offs:**
- Cost of forming/maintaining entities in multiple jurisdictions
- Accounting complexity (multiple tax filings)
- Compliance overhead

**Status:** Future consideration (not relevant until proven revenue from specific markets)

---

## Open Questions (No Decision Required Yet)

**OQ-001:** If SI8 forms standalone entity in Year 2, should it be Texas LLC or Delaware LLC/C-Corp?
- Texas LLC: Simpler, lower cost, fine for services agency
- Delaware C-Corp: Required for VC fundraising, higher overhead

**OQ-002:** Should PMF Strategy Inc. own SI8 entity, or should it be separate?
- PMF owns SI8: Clean holding company structure
- Separate: Cleaner if selling SI8 as standalone asset later

**OQ-003:** What is minimum revenue threshold where separate entity justified?
- Hypothesis: $10K/month MRR = $120K annual revenue
- Revisit at 6-month checkpoint
