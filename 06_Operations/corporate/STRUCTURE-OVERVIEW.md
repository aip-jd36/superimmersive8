- State: Texas
- Formation Date: 2022
- EIN: [To be added]
- Status: Active, in good standing

## Strategic Decision: Year 1 DBA Approach

### Decision Summary

**For Year 1 (2026):**
File official DBA for "SuperImmersive 8" under PMF Strategy Inc. and operate as DBA.

**For Year 2+ (if model validates):**
Option to form standalone entity (SI8 LLC/Inc.) and transfer assets, OR continue as DBA indefinitely.

### Rationale (Synthesized from Multiple Analyses)

**Why DBA for Year 1:**

1. **Minimal overhead** — $25 filing, no new EIN, no new bank account, no separate tax return
2. **Speed to market** — Can file and operate within days, not weeks
3. **Established entity** — PMF Strategy Inc. (2022) shows 3+ years of corporate history vs brand-new LLC
4. **Validation first** — Don't restructure entities before proving the business model works
5. **Professional credibility** — US S-Corp entity = easier procurement for APAC buyers (tax treaties, vendor onboarding)
6. **Future flexibility** — Can always spin out SI8 as separate entity in Year 2 if needed

**Why NOT standalone entity Year 1:**

- ❌ Time overhead (formation, new bank account, tax setup)
- ❌ Cost ($300+ formation + registered agent + annual fees)
- ❌ Premature optimization (don't know if model will scale yet)
- ❌ No meaningful benefit until fundraising or significant liability exposure

**Strategic Checkpoint (August 2026):**

If by Month 6:
- Revenue > $10K/month run rate
- Clear path to $100K+ annual revenue
- Fundraising opportunity emerges
- Liability exposure increases significantly

→ **Then** consider forming SI8 LLC/Inc. and transferring operations.

## Taiwan LLC Strategy: Master/Node Model

### Strategic Framework (Consensus from All Three Analyses)

**Core Principle:** SI8 is a **global business** with US entity as master/HQ. Taiwan LLC is optional local node for Taiwan-specific deals if needed.

**User's Strategic Intent (Confirmed):**
> "My intention is to be a global business. There may be some deals out of Taiwan, i.e. MyVideo, but if that happens, I'm fine with PMF Strategy outsourcing or having a contract with the Taiwan entity specifically to handle legalities."

**This confirms:** Master/Node structure, NOT dual-entity structure.

### Why Keep SI8 Under US Entity (PMF Strategy)

**All three analyses independently agreed:**

1. **IP Consolidation** — Catalog, filmmaker agreements, and Rights Verified process should live under ONE roof (US entity) for clean cap table, global coherence, and future M&A/valuation.

2. **Global Licensing Standard** — US copyright law and Texas/Delaware jurisdictions are universally understood by global platforms. Taiwan LLC is designed for local B2B services, not global IP licensing.

3. **Liability Isolation** — Keep US licensing risk pool separate from Taiwan consulting risk pool.

4. **Tax Simplicity** — US S-Corp pass-through is simpler than managing Taiwan corporate tax + cross-border dividend repatriation + foreign tax credits.

5. **Filmmaker Payouts** — US entity can pay global filmmakers easily (no Taiwan FX controls or 20% withholding tax on outbound payments).

6. **Future Scalability** — If SI8 scales and needs VC funding or acquisition, US entity structure is cleaner.

### When to Use Taiwan LLC (Optional)

**ONLY use Taiwan LLC if:**

1. **Taiwan buyer specifically requires local entity** (e.g., Taiwan Mobile procurement policy)
2. **Local invoicing creates significant friction reduction** (e.g., FaPiao for Taiwan corporate buyers)
3. **Tax withholding avoidance** (Taiwan companies paying foreign entities face 20% withholding unless exemption paperwork filed)

**Default assumption:** Most deals (Taiwan included) can be done through US entity. Only activate Taiwan LLC if buyer specifically needs it.

### How It Works: Intercompany Reseller Model

**If MyVideo (or another Taiwan buyer) requires Taiwan entity:**

**Structure:**
```
PMF Strategy Inc. (US) — Master Entity
  ↓ (Intercompany Reseller Agreement)
沉浸科技顧問有限公司 (Taiwan LLC) — Local Agent/Reseller
  ↓ (Sales Contract)
Taiwan Buyer (e.g., MyVideo)
```

**Flow:**

1. **Taiwan LLC signs deal** with Taiwan buyer (e.g., MyVideo)
2. **Taiwan LLC issues FaPiao** (local VAT invoice in NTD)
3. **Taiwan buyer pays Taiwan LLC** (local bank transfer, no 20% withholding)
4. **Taiwan LLC "purchases" Rights Package** from PMF Strategy via intercompany agreement
5. **Taiwan LLC transfers revenue** (minus small commission/service fee) to PMF Strategy (US)
6. **PMF Strategy pays filmmaker** their 20% royalty from US bank account

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Buyer gets local entity, local invoice, no tax friction
- ✅ IP ownership stays with US entity (PMF Strategy)
- ✅ Clean transfer pricing (intercompany agreement justifies money movement)
- ✅ Filmmaker gets paid from US (no Taiwan FX controls)

**Legal requirement:** Must have written "Intercompany Reseller & Services Agreement" between PMF Strategy and Taiwan LLC to justify money movement for IRS and Taiwan National Tax Bureau.

### Operational Posture for Year 1

**Public-Facing Brand:**
- "SuperImmersive 8 is a US-based AI film rights agency"
- Website, marketing, filmmaker-facing materials = US company positioning

**Contract Execution (Territory-Based):**

| Buyer Location | Entity Used | Why |
|----------------|-------------|-----|
| **Taiwan** (if buyer requires local) | Taiwan LLC | Local FaPiao, no withholding tax, easier procurement |
| **Taiwan** (if buyer OK with US) | PMF Strategy Inc. | Simpler, default approach |
| **Singapore, SEA, US, Global** | PMF Strategy Inc. | Standard international B2B, USD invoicing, Stripe |

**Filmmaker Agreements:**
- **ALL filmmakers sign with PMF Strategy Inc.** (centralizes IP ownership)
- Regardless of filmmaker location (Taiwan, US, global)

**Rights Verified Catalog:**
- **Owned by PMF Strategy Inc.**
- Taiwan LLC never owns catalog (only acts as sales agent if needed)

### Critical Questions to Answer (Discussion Needed)

See "DISCUSSION QUESTIONS" document for alignment conversation.

### What This Means for DBA Filing Decision

**Two paths:**

**Path A: File US DBA Now (Recommended if MyVideo entity preference unknown)**
- File "SuperImmersive 8" DBA under PMF Strategy this week
- Move forward with all contracts as PMF Strategy d/b/a SI8
- If MyVideo later requires Taiwan entity → add intercompany agreement
- **Advantage:** Don't delay on entity uncertainty

**Path B: Confirm MyVideo Preference First**
- Contact Jamie Lin / Taiwan Mobile procurement
- Ask: "Do you prefer contracting with Taiwan entity or US entity?"
- Then file DBA or activate Taiwan LLC accordingly
- **Advantage:** Perfect fit for MyVideo deal (Track 1 priority)
- **Disadvantage:** Delays entity setup

**User decision needed:** Which path?

### Gemini's Unique Insight: Taiwan Procurement Friction

**FaPiao (發票) Advantage:**

Gemini analysis highlighted that Taiwan corporate buyers strongly prefer local vendors because:
- Local entity can issue Taiwan VAT uniform invoice (FaPiao)
- No 20% withholding tax on payments to foreign entities
- No international wire transfer
- No complex tax exemption paperwork

**Semantic Brand Match:**

"沉浸科技顧問有限公司" literally translates to "Immersive Technology Consulting Co., Ltd."
- "沉浸科技" = "Immersive Tech"
- Fortunate semantic alignment with "SuperImmersive 8"
- Makes brand continuity clean if using Taiwan entity

**Gemini's recommendation:** Use Taiwan LLC for all Taiwan deals (more bullish than ChatGPT/Claude).

**User's decision overrides:** Use Taiwan LLC ONLY if buyer requires it (more conservative, globally-focused approach).

## Addressing Buyer Perception: "Is DBA a Red Flag?"

### Consensus from Three Independent Analyses

**Answer: NO. DBA is completely normal and NOT a red flag for enterprise buyers.**

### Why Buyers Don't Care About DBAs

**What procurement/legal teams actually evaluate:**

✅ **Legal entity existence** — Is there a real corporation we can contract with?
✅ **Contract enforceability** — Can we sue them if they breach?
✅ **Tax compliance** — Do they have an EIN and proper tax documentation?
✅ **Payment infrastructure** — Can we wire money to a legitimate bank account?
✅ **Address & jurisdiction** — Where is the entity registered?

**What they DON'T care about:**

❌ Whether brand name matches legal entity name
❌ Whether it's a DBA vs standalone entity
❌ What the parent company is called (as long as it's legitimate)

### What WOULD Be Red Flags

These things would trigger buyer concern:

❌ **No legal entity at all** — Just "SuperImmersive 8" or personal name with no corporate structure
❌ **Brand new entity** — "SI8 LLC (formed February 2026)" looks like you started yesterday
❌ **Inconsistent naming** — Website says one thing, contract says another, invoice says a third
❌ **Unrelated parent company** — "Bob's Plumbing Inc. d/b/a SuperImmersive 8" raises questions
❌ **Acting sketchy** — Defensive or evasive when asked about legal structure

### PMF Strategy Inc. as Parent: Feature, Not Bug

**Why PMF Strategy Inc. actually HELPS credibility:**

1. **"Strategy" reinforces value prop** — SI8's core offering is risk mitigation and legal vetting. A parent company called "Strategy Inc." reinforces that this is a clinical, professional operation (not just artists making cool videos).

2. **Established entity (2022)** — 3+ years of corporate history vs brand-new entity shows stability.

3. **US Corporation advantage** — For APAC buyers, a US S-Corp is easier to onboard than a foreign freelancer (established tax treaties, no complex withholding).

4. **Track record** — PMF Strategy already closed 2 deals in 2023, showing operational history.

## The "Mullet Strategy" — Brand vs Legal Presentation

**Principle:** Creative brand in front, corporate legal in back.

## If a Buyer Asks: "What's PMF Strategy?"

### Standard Response (Matter-of-Fact)

**Option 1 (Recommended):**

> "PMF Strategy is our parent company, established in 2022. We operate our AI film rights business under the SuperImmersive 8 brand. It's a standard DBA structure — similar to how many production companies and agencies operate."

**Option 2 (Simpler):**

> "That's our legal entity. We do business as SuperImmersive 8."

**Option 3 (If they ask about PMF's other business):**

> "PMF Strategy previously did strategy consulting work. We're now focused on AI film rights and licensing under the SI8 brand."

**Key principle:** Be matter-of-fact and confident. Don't over-explain or act defensive. If you treat it as normal (because it is), buyers will too.

## Year 2+ Transition Path (If Needed)

### When to Consider Forming SI8 as Standalone Entity

**Triggers for forming SI8 LLC/Inc.:**

1. **Revenue threshold** — Consistent $10K+/month run rate or $100K+ annual revenue
2. **Fundraising opportunity** — External investors want clean cap table
3. **Liability exposure** — Significant IP risk that should be separated from PMF Strategy
4. **International expansion** — Need local entities in Taiwan, Singapore, etc.
5. **Acquisition interest** — Buyer wants to acquire SI8 as standalone asset

### Asset Transfer Process (Clean Transition)

**If you form SI8 LLC/Inc. in Year 2:**

1. **Form new entity** — "SuperImmersive 8 LLC" or "SuperImmersive 8 Inc." (Texas or Delaware)

2. **Transfer IP** — Assign trademarks, domain, brand assets from PMF Strategy → SI8 Inc.

3. **Assign contracts** — Execute "Assignment and Assumption Agreement" for:
   - Filmmaker shopping agreements
   - Active licensing deals
   - Vendor agreements

4. **Novation for buyers** — For active deals, get buyers to sign 1-page novation:
   - "PMF Strategy Inc. d/b/a SI8 assigns all rights/obligations → SI8 Inc."
   - This is standard and non-controversial

5. **Update documentation** — All new Rights Verified Packages issued by SI8 Inc.

6. **Legacy documentation** — Old Chain of Title docs remain valid (add note: "PMF Strategy Inc. d/b/a SI8 operations transferred to SI8 Inc. effective [Date]")

7. **Close DBA** — Cancel Texas DBA filing for SI8 under PMF Strategy

**Timeline:** 30-60 days for clean transition
**Cost:** $300-500 (formation) + $1,500-3,000 (lawyer for contract assignments)

### Three Acceptable Outcomes (All Valid)

1. **High-earning services agency** — Continue as DBA indefinitely, scale to $250K-500K+/year revenue
2. **Self-serve platform** — Form SI8 Inc., build tech platform, raise seed round
3. **Hybrid** — Services agency funds platform development, eventual VC raise

**Year 1 work is identical regardless of which path emerges.** Don't optimize for a specific outcome yet.

---

## Risk Considerations

### Primary Risk: Liability Contamination

**The concern:**

If SI8 faces IP litigation (e.g., brand claims SI8-licensed content infringed their trademark), the lawsuit names PMF Strategy Inc. as defendant.

If PMF Strategy has other assets (cash reserves, other business lines), those assets are exposed to judgment.

**Mitigation strategies for Year 1:**

1. **E&O Insurance** — Investigate Errors & Omissions insurance for media liability (future investigation, not Year 1 blocker)
2. **Strong contracts** — Indemnification clauses shift liability to filmmakers for IP they represent they own
3. **Conservative vetting** — Rights Verified process filters out high-risk content
4. **Low early exposure** — At <$50K annual revenue, litigation risk is minimal (not worth suing)

**Decision point:** If revenue scales significantly (>$200K/year) or high-profile brand deals emerge, revisit entity separation.

### Secondary Risk: Tax Complexity

**S-Corp considerations:**

- S-Corp income flows through to personal tax return (Schedule K-1)
- Must pay yourself "reasonable salary" if actively working in business
- If SI8 becomes primary income source, ensure salary vs distribution split is IRS-compliant

**Not a Year 1 concern** — Your CPA can advise on salary/distribution when revenue scales.

---

## Key Principles (Guiding Framework)

1. **Lead with brand, deliver on legal** — SI8 is the brand buyers see; PMF Strategy is the legal entity that signs contracts.

2. **Consistency is key** — Website, emails, marketing = SI8 brand. Contracts, invoices, bank wires = PMF Strategy Inc. d/b/a SI8.

3. **Matter-of-fact presentation** — Don't apologize for or over-explain the structure. It's normal.

4. **Validate before restructuring** — Prove the model works before investing in entity complexity.

5. **Strategic optionality** — DBA now, standalone entity later if needed. Keep options open.

**Next Review:** August 2026 (6-month checkpoint)
