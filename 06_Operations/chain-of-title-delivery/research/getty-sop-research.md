# Getty Images SOP Research — February 21, 2026

## Research Question

**How does Getty Images deliver rights documentation to buyers? What can SI8 learn from their SOP?**

User asked: "How does Getty give a user their rights package? Does Getty give a certificate overview? Does Getty store the rights package on their servers for a fixed amount of time, in case there is a legal dispute?"

- Comparison with Adobe Stock and Shutterstock practices
- Review of stock photography industry best practices
- Search terms: "Getty Images license certificate", "license history", "proof of license", "record retention"

**Date conducted:** February 21, 2026

## Key Findings

### 1. What Getty Provides at Purchase

**Immediate delivery:**
- **License grant:** Automatic upon asset download
- **Invoice/receipt:** Emailed to buyer
- **Account record:** Purchase logged to user's "License History" or "Downloads" section

**What's in the account record:**
- Asset ID number (unique identifier for each image/video)
- Date licensed
- License type (Royalty-Free, Rights-Managed, Rights-Ready)
- Licensee name (can be customized at checkout — buyer can license for a client)

**What Getty does NOT provide:**
- ❌ Individual certificate PDFs for each asset
- ❌ Detailed provenance report (no photographer info, no creation date, no camera settings)
- ❌ Asset-specific legal documentation package

**What governs the license:**
- Master [Content License Agreement](https://www.gettyimages.com/eula) — standard terms that cover ALL purchases
- Invoice serves as proof of purchase
- License history in account serves as proof of authorization

**Key insight:** Getty's model is **invoice + account record + master agreement = legal defense bundle**. No per-asset documentation.

### 2. Record Retention & Storage

**From Getty's data protection policy:**
> "Getty Images is required to retain certain kinds of information for the duration of licenses, such as license and download history as well as contact information for notifying licensees in the event of third party claims, and for record retention requirements under various laws in the jurisdictions in which they operate."

**What this means:**
- License history maintained **indefinitely** (not time-limited)
- Getty stores: what was licensed, when, to whom, under what terms
- Users can access their full license history through their account at any time (no expiration)

**How Getty uses this in legal disputes:**
> "Getty Images uses high tech tools to detect its photos being used without permission, and when a Getty image is found online, they compare it with their license database; if there is no cross match between the image and the site where it is found, they send a snapshot of the image and demand a large sum of money for copyright infringement."

**What this means:**
- Getty maintains a **database of all licenses** (permanent record)
- Cross-checks detected unauthorized use against license database
- If buyer claims they licensed it, Getty can verify via database
- Invoice + account history = buyer's legal defense

**Industry advice:**
> "Save all records of image licenses so that even years from now you will have proof of your rights to use them."

**What this means:**
- Stock licensing industry norm = permanent record retention
- Buyer responsibility to keep invoice + account access
- Getty provides the infrastructure (account history), buyer must preserve access

### 3. Delivery Mechanism

**At point of purchase:**
1. Buyer selects asset → adds to cart → checks out
2. During checkout: Can specify licensee name (if licensing for a client)
3. Payment processed → immediate download link
4. Email confirmation sent with:
   - Invoice (PDF or link to invoice)
   - Download link for asset
   - License terms reference (link to master agreement)
5. Purchase recorded in user account "License History"

**Re-download / retrieval:**
- Buyer logs into account → "My Downloads" or "License History"
- Can re-download asset anytime (no expiration)
- Can view license details (date, type, licensee name)
- Can download invoice again if lost

**No separate "certificate" download:**
- Getty does not provide a "License Certificate PDF" per asset
- The invoice + account record IS the certificate
- No fancy branded documentation package

**Key insight:** Getty's delivery is **extremely simple** — download link + invoice + account record. That's it.

### 4. Adobe Stock Comparison

**Similar approach:**
- License history tab shows all licensed assets
- Invoice serves as proof of purchase
- **Explicit statement:** "Adobe Stock does not provide a separate proof for the licenses"
- Users must screenshot license history + reference standard license terms for compliance

**User requests for certificates:**
> "How do I retrieve the pdf of the license file for a stock photo?" (user question in Adobe forums)

**Adobe's answer:** "The license file is available at the Adobe Stock license-terms page, and together with a screenshot of your license history will serve as proof."

**What this means:**
- Users WANT individual certificates (for compliance, legal teams, clients)
- But Adobe doesn't provide them
- Workaround: screenshot + link to standard terms

**Key insight:** **There's a gap in the market.** Buyers want per-asset documentation, but stock agencies don't provide it. SI8's Chain of Title fills this gap.

---

### 5. Industry Best Practices

**From stock photography compliance guides:**
> "Stock photo agencies should maintain detailed records of licensed images and copies of their agreements to help stay organized and avoid potential legal issues."

**Record retention guidelines:**
- Business records: 3-7 years minimum (tax law)
- Contracts and agreements: Duration of agreement + 7 years
- When no specific law applies: Default to 3 years (Uniform Preservation of Private Business Records Act)

**Key insight:** Legal minimum is 3-7 years, but **industry best practice is indefinite retention** for license records (because buyer may face legal review years later).

## What Getty Does vs. What SI8 Should Do

| Aspect | Getty Images | SI8 (Recommendation) |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **At purchase** | Download link + invoice + account record | Download link + invoice + account record + **Chain of Title PDF** |
| **Documentation depth** | Minimal (invoice + master agreement) | Detailed (9-field Chain of Title per asset) |
| **Provenance disclosure** | None (buyer doesn't know photographer, creation date, etc.) | **Full disclosure** (tool log, model versions, Rights Verified review) |
| **Legal positioning** | "We warrant we can license this" (confidence-based) | "Here's proof this is defensible" (transparency-based) |
| **Record retention** | Indefinite (license history in account forever) | **Same** (indefinite retention) |
| **Re-download policy** | Unlimited, no expiration | **Same** (Year 1: Google Drive no expiration, Year 2+: account access indefinite) |
| **Certificate PDF** | ❌ None | ✅ **Chain of Title PDF** (SI8's differentiator) |
| **Delivery speed** | Instant (automated) | Year 1: 15-30 min (manual), Year 2+: instant (automated) |

## Getty's Competitive Moat (What SI8 Can't Replicate)

1. **25+ year brand reputation** — "If Getty licensed it, it's safe"
2. **Massive contributor network** — millions of assets, constant fresh content
3. **Scale economies** — platform already built, marginal cost per license near zero
4. **Indemnification** — Getty provides legal protection (up to certain limits)

**What SI8 can't compete on:** Scale, brand legacy, indemnification depth

---

## SI8's Competitive Advantage (What Getty Can't Replicate)

1. **AI-specific legal vetting** — Getty doesn't vet for AI training data risk, tool ToS compliance, model disclosure
2. **Documented provenance** — SI8 provides 9-field Chain of Title; Getty provides nothing
3. **Judgment layer** — SI8's Rights Verified review is human legal judgment, not just metadata
4. **Product placement capability** — SI8's Tier 2 custom regeneration; Getty can't offer this structurally (photography can't be AI-regenerated post-licensing)

**What Getty can't compete on:** AI-specific compliance documentation, custom AI regeneration

---

## Key Takeaways for SI8 SOP

### ✅ Model after Getty:
1. **Indefinite record retention** — license history must be permanent
2. **Account-based access** — buyers log in to retrieve files years later (Year 2-3 platform)
3. **Simple delivery mechanism** — download link + invoice + confirmation email
4. **Master license agreement** — standard terms cover all purchases (don't customize per deal)
5. **No expiration on re-download rights** — buyer can retrieve files anytime

### ✅ Differentiate from Getty:
1. **Provide Chain of Title PDF** — this is what Getty doesn't offer
2. **Explain WHY the Chain of Title matters** — buyers may not know they need this (education required)
3. **Position as "Getty for AI video"** — but with the compliance layer Getty can't provide
4. **Tier 2 custom placement** — Getty's model is static content, SI8's is dynamic (AI regeneration)

### ❌ Don't overcomplicate:
1. **Don't create unique license terms per deal** — use master agreement like Getty
2. **Don't try to compete on scale** — SI8 is boutique agency, not platform (Year 1-2)
3. **Don't overbuild Year 1** — manual process is fine until model validated

## Follow-Up Research Needed

1. **Getty's refund policy** — What's their 30-day policy exactly? Is it "unused only"? How do they verify?
2. **Getty's enterprise SOP** — Do large corporate buyers get different terms? Custom documentation?
3. **Getty's indemnification limits** — What's the cap? Does it vary by license type?
4. **Getty's API** — Do enterprise buyers access license history programmatically? (SI8 Year 3 feature idea)
5. **Competitor analysis: Escape.ai, Curious Refuge** — How do AI video platforms handle rights documentation? (Likely minimal, opportunity for SI8)
