# Master License Agreement — Draft Template

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DISCLAIMER

**THIS IS A DRAFT TEMPLATE ONLY. NOT LEGAL ADVICE.**

**Before using this agreement with any customer:**
1. ✅ Have a Taiwan-licensed attorney review and revise
2. ✅ Have a lawyer in buyer's jurisdiction review (if different from Taiwan)
3. ✅ Confirm governing law and dispute resolution clauses
4. ✅ Verify indemnification and limitation of liability caps
5. ✅ Update based on first 3 real deals (edge cases, buyer requests)

**Do NOT use this as-is.** This is a starting framework for lawyer review.

## Purpose

The **Master License Agreement** is the one standard contract that governs **all** SI8 purchases. Buyers agree to it once (at first purchase or via website checkbox), and it covers every subsequent order.

**Why this matters:**
- **Familiar model:** Getty, Shutterstock, Adobe Stock all use master agreements
- **Scalable:** No per-deal contract negotiations
- **Enforceable:** Standard terms reduce legal ambiguity
- **Buyer-friendly:** Procurement teams can pre-approve SI8 as vendor once

**How it works:**
1. Buyer checks box at checkout: "I agree to SI8 Master License Agreement"
2. Agreement lives at: `superimmersive8.com/license-terms` (always accessible)
3. Each Order references the Master Agreement
4. Chain of Title serves as "Exhibit A" proving asset-specific compliance

This Master License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between
SuperImmersive 8 ("SI8," "we," "us," or "our"), a business operating
in Taipei, Taiwan, and you ("Licensee," "you," or "your").

By purchasing, downloading, or using any Content licensed through SI8,
you agree to be bound by this Agreement.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    a license to use Content, as evidenced by an Order ID and Invoice.

    Content by an end user. If your deployment exceeds 500,000 impressions,
    contact SI8 for extended licensing.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3. RESTRICTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3.1 Prohibited Uses

    You may NOT:

    (a) Resell, redistribute, or sublicense the Content as standalone
        stock content (e.g., on stock video marketplaces)
    (b) Use the Content in any way that infringes third-party rights
    (c) Use the Content in defamatory, libelous, or unlawful materials
    (d) Transfer your license to a third party without SI8's prior
        written consent
    (e) Claim ownership of the Content or misrepresent its source
    (f) Remove or alter any copyright notices, watermarks, or metadata
        embedded in the Content

    If you purchased a Tier 1 license, you may NOT modify, edit, or
    alter the Content without upgrading to a Tier 2 license.

3.3 Category Exclusivity (Tier 2 Only)

    If your Order includes category-exclusive rights, SI8 will not
    license the same Content to competing brands in the specified

    Your custom branded version remains exclusive to you indefinitely.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4. PAYMENT AND REFUNDS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4.1 Payment

    All fees are due in full at the time of Order. SI8 accepts payment
    via credit card (Stripe), PayPal, or wire transfer (for orders
    over $10,000 USD).

4.2 No Refunds

    All sales are final. SI8 does not offer refunds after Content has
    been delivered, except as required by law or if SI8 cannot deliver
    the Content as described in the Order within 7 business days.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5. CHAIN OF TITLE AND SAFE LANE VERIFICATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5.1 Chain of Title Documentation

    Each Order includes a Chain of Title & Compliance Log ("Chain of
    Title"), which serves as Exhibit A to this Agreement and documents:

    (a) AI tool provenance (tools used, versions, production dates)
    (b) Model disclosure (AI models, training data information)
    (c) Safe Lane verification (SI8's review sign-off)
    (d) Commercial use authorization (tool ToS compliance)
    (e) Modification rights status
    (f) Category conflicts and exclusivity terms
    (g) Territory and term
    (h) Regeneration rights (Tier 2 only)
    (i) Version history

5.2 Nature of Safe Lane Verification

    IMPORTANT: The Chain of Title documents SI8's review process and
    filmmaker-provided disclosures. It is NOT legal advice, a warranty,
    an indemnification, or a certification of legal compliance.

    SI8's Safe Lane process is designed to reduce legal risk by verifying:
    - AI tools used are authorized for commercial use
    - Content does not contain unauthorized likenesses or copyrighted material
    - Filmmaker has provided required disclosures

    However, SI8 does not guarantee that the Content is free from all
    legal risks or third-party claims. Licensee's use of the Content
    is at Licensee's own risk.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
6. WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

6.1 SI8's Warranties

    SI8 warrants that:

    (a) SI8 has the right to license the Content to you
    (b) The Content was created using the AI tools disclosed in the
        Chain of Title
    (c) SI8 conducted its Safe Lane review process in good faith
    (d) To SI8's knowledge, the Content does not contain unauthorized
        likenesses or copyrighted material

6.2 Disclaimer of Other Warranties

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTION 6.1, THE CONTENT IS PROVIDED
    "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

    SI8 DOES NOT WARRANT THAT:
    - The Content is free from all legal risks or third-party claims
    - The Content will be suitable for your specific use case
    - The AI tools used will remain commercially available in the future
    - Training data used by AI tool providers is free from copyright issues

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

7.1 Liability Cap

    IN NO EVENT SHALL SI8'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO LICENSEE FOR ALL CLAIMS
    ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE
    CONTENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO SI8 FOR THE SPECIFIC CONTENT
    THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM.

7.2 Exclusion of Consequential Damages

    IN NO EVENT SHALL SI8 BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
    SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT
    LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES,
    EVEN IF SI8 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.3 Basis of the Bargain

    You acknowledge that the fees charged for the Content reflect this
    allocation of risk and that SI8 would not enter into this Agreement
    without these limitations.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

8.1 Licensee's Indemnification

    out of or related to:

    (a) Your use of the Content in violation of this Agreement
    (b) Your combination of the Content with other materials
    (c) Your representation or warranty to third parties regarding
        the Content

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Critical Issues for Lawyer Review

### 1. Governing Law & Jurisdiction (Section 10.1-10.2)

**Current status:** `[TO BE DETERMINED BY LAWYER]`

**Options:**
- **Taiwan law, Taipei jurisdiction:** SI8 is Taiwan-based
- **Singapore law, Singapore jurisdiction:** Many APAC buyers prefer Singapore
- **Buyer's jurisdiction:** Most buyer-friendly, but impractical for SI8 to manage
- **Hybrid:** Taiwan law, but arbitration in neutral location (Singapore)

**Lawyer should advise:** Which jurisdiction protects SI8 best while remaining acceptable to APAC buyers?

### 2. Indemnification Scope (Section 8)

**Current draft:** Licensee indemnifies SI8 for breach/misuse

**Missing:** Does SI8 provide **any** indemnification to Licensee?

**Options:**
- **No indemnification:** Current draft (SI8 provides none)
- **Limited indemnification:** SI8 indemnifies for breach of Section 6.1 warranties only, capped at Order value
- **Tiered indemnification:** Tier 2 buyers get limited indemnity, Tier 1 buyers get none

**Lawyer should advise:** Is "no indemnification" acceptable to enterprise buyers? Or will lack of indemnity kill deals?

### 3. Limitation of Liability Cap (Section 7.1)

**Current draft:** Capped at Order value (e.g., $8,000 for Tier 1, $50,000 for Tier 2)

**Concern:** Is this cap enforceable in all target jurisdictions (Taiwan, Singapore, US, EU)?

**Lawyer should review:**
- Are consequential damages exclusions enforceable?
- Does Taiwan law permit liability caps in B2B contracts?
- Should there be separate caps for different claim types?

### 4. Safe Lane Disclaimer Language (Section 5.2)

**Current draft:** "NOT legal advice, a warranty, an indemnification, or a certification"

**Concern:** Is this disclaimer strong enough? Or does Section 6.1 ("SI8 warrants...") undermine it?

**Lawyer should advise:**
- Does Section 6.1 create implied warranties that conflict with Section 5.2?
- Should Safe Lane language be even more cautious?
- Is "good faith" standard in 6.1(c) too vague?

### 5. Refund Policy (Section 4.2)

**Current draft:** "No refunds after delivery"

**Concern:**
- Is this enforceable in Taiwan? Singapore? EU (if applicable)?
- Does "required by law" carve-out create ambiguity?

**Lawyer should review:** Local consumer protection laws (even though B2B, some jurisdictions extend protections)

### 6. AI-Specific Risks

**Current draft:** Does NOT explicitly address:
- AI training data lawsuits (e.g., if Runway/Sora get sued)
- Platform policy changes (e.g., YouTube bans AI content)
- Deepfake/likeness claims (even after Safe Lane review)

**Lawyer should advise:** Should these risks be explicitly disclaimed? Or does general disclaimer in 6.2 cover them?

---

## Year 1 Implementation

### How to Use This Agreement

**Option A (Simplest):** Post on website, buyers accept via checkbox
1. Upload final version to `superimmersive8.com/license-terms`
2. At checkout, checkbox: "I have read and agree to SI8 Master License Agreement"
3. Order confirmation email includes link to agreement

**Option B (More formal):** Separate sign-on for first purchase
1. First-time buyers sign Master Agreement via DocuSign
2. Subsequent purchases reference signed agreement
3. More admin work, but cleaner for enterprise

**Recommendation:** Option A for Year 1 (simpler), Option B if enterprise buyers request it

### When to Reference This Agreement

Every delivery email should include:
```
Full license terms governed by SI8 Master License Agreement:
→ superimmersive8.com/license-terms
```

Every License Summary should include:
```
This License Summary is a quick reference only. Full terms are
governed by the SI8 Master License Agreement.
```

Every Chain of Title should include:
```
This Chain of Title serves as Exhibit A to the SI8 Master License
Agreement, documenting the specific asset licensed under Order #[####].
```

## Maintenance & Updates

### When to Update

**Trigger for v1.1, v1.2, etc.:**
- Lawyer feedback after initial review
- First 3 deals reveal edge cases not covered
- Buyer requests terms changes (evaluate if applicable to all buyers)
- Law changes in target jurisdictions
- AI-specific legal precedents (e.g., major training data lawsuit)

### How to Update

1. **Draft new version** with changes tracked
2. **Lawyer review** (required for substantive changes)
3. **Post new version** at `superimmersive8.com/license-terms`
4. **Update "Last Updated" date** at top of agreement
5. **Increment version number** (e.g., v1.0 → v1.1)
6. **Email existing buyers** if changes are material (e.g., new restrictions)

**Important:** Changes only apply to NEW orders placed after update. Existing orders remain governed by version at time of purchase.

---

## Cost Estimate

**Lawyer review of this agreement:**
- Taiwan commercial lawyer: ~$2,000-$5,000 USD
- Singapore commercial lawyer: ~$3,000-$7,000 USD
- US lawyer (if targeting US buyers): ~$5,000-$10,000 USD

**When to invest:**
- ✅ Before first deal worth >$10K (justify legal expense)
- ✅ Before first Tier 2 deal (higher risk)
- ⚠️ Optional for first few Tier 1 deals <$5K (lower risk, but still recommended)

---

**Created:** February 21, 2026
**Version:** v0.1 (DRAFT — not lawyer-reviewed)
**Status:** Ready for lawyer review
**Next:** Send to Taiwan commercial lawyer by Month 2
