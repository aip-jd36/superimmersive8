## Email Tone Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use buyer's first name (warm, personal)
- Explain *why* the Chain of Title matters (not just *what* it is)
- Provide clear CTAs (download links, payment links, calendar links)
- Include support contact in every email (reply or jd@superimmersive8.com)
- Use plain language (avoid legalese unless necessary)
- Include catalog ID in every subject line (easy to search)

**DON'T:**
- Use all caps (except section headers)
- Over-promise legal guarantees ("100% lawsuit-proof")
- Assume buyer understands AI video rights landscape
- Send attachments (use download links instead, to avoid email size limits)
- Use overly formal/corporate tone (this is Year 1, founder-led)

---

## HTML Email Version (Year 2+)

Year 1 = plain text (universal compatibility, easy to maintain)
Year 2+ = HTML (branded, responsive, better visual hierarchy)

When transitioning to HTML:
- Match website design system (warm light theme, golden accent)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Plain text fallback always included
- No heavy images (keep load time fast)
- Accessible (screen reader friendly)

---

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Feb 21, 2026 | Plain text emails for Year 1 | Easy to maintain, universal compatibility, low tech overhead |
| Feb 21, 2026 | Include catalog ID in every subject line | Makes emails searchable for buyer's compliance team |
| Feb 21, 2026 | No file attachments (download links only) | Avoids email size limits, allows file updates if needed |
| Feb 21, 2026 | 7-day follow-up email standard | Captures feedback early, builds relationship, identifies issues |

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Finalize first deal proposal email (customize Template 5)
2. Set up email templates in Gmail (canned responses / templates feature)
3. Test all download links in incognito mode before sending
4. Document first buyer's feedback on email clarity
