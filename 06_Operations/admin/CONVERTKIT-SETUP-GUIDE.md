**Send Timing:** 3 days after Email #1

**Subject Line:**
```
The $150K mistake brands are making with AI video
```

**Preview Text:**
```
Willful infringement penalties + platform removals
```

**Email Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: If your legal team flags your AI campaign tomorrow, do you have the documentation to prove good faith?

Most brands don't — until it's too late.

Here's what happened to brands without documentation:

• Willful infringement penalty: up to $150,000 per work
• Colorado AI Act violation: $20,000 per incident
• Platform removal: TikTok's 340% enforcement increase in 2025

The gap isn't the content. It's the paper trail.

That's why we built the Safe Lane vetting process:

1. Pre-screen (15 min): Tool verification, No List check
2. Full review (60 min): 7 categories, clear thresholds
3. Risk tier assignment: Certified / Standard / Caution / Reject
4. Rights Package output: 9-field documentation

### **Step 6: Add Email #3 (Adobe Gap)**

#### **EMAIL #3: Adobe Competitive Gap**

**Send Timing:** 4 days after Email #2 (Day 7 from start)

**Subject Line:**
```
Adobe won't protect Sora, Runway, or Kling. We will.
```

**Preview Text:**
```
Firefly indemnification excludes third-party tools
```

**Email Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Adobe's Firefly indemnification only covers Firefly.

If your creative team wants:
• Sora (best cinematic quality)
• Runway (best motion control)
• Kling (best at complex scenes)

Adobe explicitly excludes those tools from indemnification.

Read their terms: "Adobe will have no liability for any Claim to the extent that the Claim is based on... any combination of a Firefly Output with any other material."

This is the gap SI8 fills.

Adobe = safe but boring (Firefly only)
SI8 = best creative tools made safe (through Safe Lane vetting)

Our Rights Package documents:
• Tool provenance (which AI tools, versions, paid plans)
• Model disclosure (which AI models generated content)
• Safe Lane sign-off (legal review + risk tier)
• Commercial use authorization (ToS compliance verified)
• Version history (human authorship for copyrightability)
• + 4 more fields

→ See the Rights Package breakdown: https://www.superimmersive8.com/safe-lane-rights-package.html

### **Step 7: Add Email #4 (C2PA vs SI8)**

1. Click **"Add email"**
2. Email settings:
   - **Send:** 3 days after previous email (Day 10 total)
   - **Subject line:** (see below)
   - **Preview text:** (see below)

#### **EMAIL #4: C2PA Differentiation**

**Send Timing:** 3 days after Email #3 (Day 10 from start)

**Subject Line:**
```
C2PA proves WHERE. SI8 proves you can USE it.
```

**Preview Text:**
```
Provenance vs. legal safety — the critical difference
```

**Email Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

C2PA (Content Credentials) is everywhere — Adobe, Microsoft, OpenAI all use it.

It's great at ONE thing: proving provenance (where content came from).

But here's what C2PA explicitly does NOT do:

"Content Credentials do not provide value judgments about whether a given set of provenance data is 'true'... or good or bad."

Translation: C2PA proves the video came from Runway.
It doesn't prove the video won't get you sued by Disney.

That's the difference:

C2PA = the receipt
SI8 Safe Lane = the legal audit

C2PA will soon be commoditized (open standard, auto-generated).

SI8's moat is the judgment layer — subjective legal review that software cannot automate:
• IP assessment (does this look like copyrighted characters?)
• Brand safety scan (suitable for mainstream brand attachment?)
• Human authorship quality (does this meet USCO copyrightability standard?)
• CMI preservation check (watermarks/attribution intact?)

This is why documentation creates value.

### **Step 8: Add Email #5 (Final Check-In)**

1. Click **"Add email"**
2. Email settings:
   - **Send:** 4 days after previous email (Day 14 total)
   - **Subject line:** (see below)
   - **Preview text:** (see below)

#### **EMAIL #5: Final Follow-Up**

**Send Timing:** 4 days after Email #4 (Day 14 from start)

**Subject Line:**
```
Still evaluating AI content options?
```

**Preview Text:**
```
Final check-in + Q2 2026 case study preview
```

**Email Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to check in one last time.

You downloaded our Legal Risk Brief two weeks ago — any questions come up as you reviewed it?

Common questions I get:

• "Can we use this for existing AI campaigns?"
• "What if we already have footage from Midjourney/Runway?"
• "How does this integrate with our existing agency workflow?"
• "What's the pricing structure?"

Happy to jump on a quick 15-min call to walk through your specific situation.

→ Book here: https://calendly.com/aipenguins/superimmersive8

If now's not the right time, no worries — you'll hear from me when we have case studies to share (targeting Q2 2026).

- Click PDF links to verify they download

**✅ Sequence Scheduling:**
- In ConvertKit, view your subscriber
- Check timeline — Emails 2-5 should be scheduled for Days 3, 7, 10, 14

---

### **Step 17: Remove Test Subscriber**

After testing:

1. In ConvertKit → "Grow" → "Subscribers"
2. Find your test subscriber
3. Click name → "Actions" → "Delete subscriber"
4. Confirm deletion

*(This prevents you from receiving the full 5-email sequence)*

---

## PART 6: Ongoing Management

### **Monitoring (Weekly)**

**Check these metrics in ConvertKit:**

1. **"Grow" → "Subscribers"**
   - Total subscribers
   - Growth rate (new per week)

2. **"Send" → "Sequences" → Click your sequence**
   - Open rate (aim for >30%)
   - Click rate (aim for >5%)
   - Unsubscribe rate (should be <2%)

3. **"Grow" → "Tags"**
   - How many "Lead - Brand" vs "Lead - Filmmaker"
   - Segment by role for future campaigns

---

### **Monthly Optimization**

**If open rates are low (<25%):**
- Test new subject lines
- Adjust send times
- Shorten email length

**If click rates are low (<3%):**
- Make CTAs more prominent
- Test different link text
- Add more value before asking for call

**If unsubscribe rate is high (>5%):**
- Emails may be too frequent
- Content not relevant to subscriber
- Adjust sequence timing or content

---

## Troubleshooting

### **"Subscriber not receiving Email #1"**

**Check:**
1. ConvertKit → Subscriber → Activity tab — was email sent?
2. Check spam folder
3. Verify sequence is "Active"
4. Check subscriber's email address is correct

---

### **"Zapier not triggering"**

**Check:**
1. Zap status is "On" (green)
2. Formspree form ID matches Zap trigger
3. Zapier "Zap History" for error messages
4. Formspree integration is connected (Settings → Integrations)

---

### **"PDF links not working"**

**Check:**
1. Google Drive links are set to "Anyone with link can view"
2. Links don't have `?usp=sharing` at end (remove if present)
3. Test links in incognito browser
4. Re-share PDFs and get new links
