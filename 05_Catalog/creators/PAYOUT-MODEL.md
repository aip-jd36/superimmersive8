# SI8 Creator Payout Model v1.0

**Date:** February 22, 2026
**Status:** Initial model (pre-launch)
**Next review:** After first 10 deals close

---

## Executive Summary

SI8 operates a **two-tier payout model**:

1. **Tier 1 (Catalog Licensing):** 20% creator royalty (SI8 keeps 80%)
   → Modeled after Getty/Shutterstock stock platform economics

2. **Tier 2 (Custom AI Placement):** 50/50 revenue split
   → Production service model (creator does regeneration work)

**Why this matters:** We are a **stock platform** for Tier 1 (passive income), and a **production partner** for Tier 2 (active collaboration).

---

## The Industry Context (Why 80/20 is Fair)

### Getty Images / iStock Creator Payouts
- **Non-Exclusive:** Creator gets 15% (photos), 20% (video)
- **Exclusive:** Creator gets 25%–45% (scales with volume)
- **Platform keeps:** 55%–85%

### Shutterstock Creator Payouts
- **Standard tier:** Creator gets 15%
- **Top tier (1,000+ licenses/year):** Creator gets 40%
- **Platform keeps:** 60%–85%

### Why do stock platforms take 60%–85%?
Because they provide:
- Global marketplace with millions of buyers
- Enterprise sales teams
- Legal infrastructure & indemnification
- Hosting, search, payment processing
- Marketing spend (Google Ads, SEO, partnerships)

**SI8's Value Proposition:**
- Rights Verified vetting process (legal defensibility)
- Chain of Title documentation (buyers pay premium for this)
- Direct enterprise sales (we pitch to brands, not hope for search traffic)
- Custom placement opportunities (Tier 2 upsell)

---

## Tier 1: Catalog Licensing (Stock Royalty Model)

### Payout Structure
- **Creator receives:** 20% royalty on every sale
- **SI8 retains:** 80%

### What "Royalty" Means
- **Passive income:** Creator does no additional work after submission
- **Unlimited licensing:** Same asset can be licensed multiple times to different buyers
- **Monthly payments:** Batch payouts once per month (if balance ≥ $50)

### Example Math

| License Type | Sale Price | Creator (20%) | SI8 (80%) |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Standard License | $1,500 | $300 | $1,200 |
| Standard License | $2,000 | $400 | $1,600 |
| Extended License | $3,000 | $600 | $2,400 |
| Extended License | $5,000 | $1,000 | $4,000 |

**Key insight:** A single asset that gets licensed 5 times at $1,500 = **$1,500 in passive creator income** ($300 × 5).

### What Creator Gets (Tier 1)
✓ Passive income from multiple licenses
✓ SI8 handles all sales, legal, buyer negotiations
✓ Chain of Title documentation (proof of commercial clearance)
✓ Inclusion in SI8's curated catalog (brand visibility)
✓ Opportunity for Tier 2 upsells (50/50 split deals)

### What Creator Does NOT Get
✗ Majority revenue share (this is stock, not agency representation)
✗ Direct buyer contact (SI8 owns the buyer relationship)
✗ Exclusivity fees (we are non-exclusive unless Tier 2)

---

## Tier 2: Custom AI Placement (Production Service Model)

### Payout Structure
- **Creator receives:** 50% of total deal value
- **SI8 retains:** 50%

**Plus optional base fee for complex projects:**
- Simple placement (1-2 scenes): No base fee, just 50/50 split
- Moderate placement (3-5 scenes): Optional $1,500 base + 50/50 split
- Complex placement (6+ scenes, multiple iterations): $2,500–$5,000 base + 50/50 split

### Why 50/50 (Not 80/20)?
Because in Tier 2, the **creator is doing active production work**:
- AI regeneration of scenes with brand elements
- Multiple revision rounds (2-3 typical)
- Brand feedback iterations
- Technical execution (prompt engineering, model selection, quality control)

This is not passive royalty—this is commissioned work.

### Example Math

| Deal Type | Total Deal | Creator (50%) | SI8 (50%) | Creator Work |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Simple placement (2 scenes) | $12,000 | $6,000 | $6,000 | ~8-12 hours |
| Moderate placement (4 scenes) | $15,000 | $7,500 | $7,500 | ~15-20 hours |
| Complex placement (8 scenes) | $20,000 | $10,000 | $10,000 | ~25-30 hours |
| Premium (broadcast, multiple deliverables) | $30,000 | $15,000 | $15,000 | ~40+ hours |

**Effective hourly rate for creator:** $250–$500/hour (premium AI production work)

### Payment Timing (Tier 2)
Different from Tier 1 batch payouts:
- **50% upfront** (when buyer makes deposit / project kicks off)
- **50% on delivery** (when buyer approves final asset)

**Example:**
- Buyer pays SI8 $15,000 for custom placement
- Creator receives $3,750 upfront (50% of their 50% share)
- Creator delivers final regenerated scenes
- Buyer approves
- Creator receives remaining $3,750

### What Creator Gets (Tier 2)
✓ 50% of premium deal value (vs. 20% in Tier 1)
✓ Direct collaboration with SI8 on creative brief
✓ Faster payment cycle (project-based, not monthly batch)
✓ Portfolio piece (custom branded work)
✓ Potential for repeat business (same brand, new campaigns)

### What Creator Commits To (Tier 2)
✓ Availability for 2-3 revision rounds
✓ 7-14 day turnaround (depending on complexity)
✓ Brand safety review (content appropriate for client)
✓ Technical execution quality (4K, clean outputs, no artifacts)

## Why We Don't Call This "Agency Representation"

**Traditional Talent Agency (CAA, WME, etc.):**
- Takes 10%–20% commission
- Works **for** the artist
- Artist keeps majority of deal value
- Artist negotiates directly with buyer
- Agency facilitates, does not own buyer relationship

**SI8 (Stock Platform + Production Partner):**
- Takes 80% on Tier 1 (stock royalty)
- Takes 50% on Tier 2 (production split)
- SI8 owns the buyer relationship
- Creator is a **contributor**, not a client

**Critical messaging difference:**
- ❌ "We want to represent you as your agent!" (implies 10–20% commission)
- ✓ "Submit your work to SI8's Rights Verified catalog and earn royalties on enterprise sales." (stock platform language)

---

## Payment Terms & Logistics

### Minimum Payout Threshold
- **Tier 1:** $50 minimum (below $50 = rolls to next month)
- **Tier 2:** No minimum (paid per project)

### Payment Schedule

- SI8 issues 1099-MISC if annual earnings ≥ $600

### International Creators
- Must provide tax residency documentation

---

## Exclusivity & Rights

- Creator cannot license same regenerated version to competing brands
- Original (non-regenerated) version remains non-exclusive

---

## Dispute Resolution

### Payout Disputes
1. Creator emails hello@superimmersive8.com with concern
2. SI8 reviews deal documentation (invoice, buyer payment proof, payout calculation)
3. Issue resolved within 5 business days or escalated to legal review

### Performance Issues (Tier 2)
If creator misses Tier 2 delivery deadline or quality standards:
1. Written warning + extension (first instance)
2. Withholding of final 50% payment until issue resolved
3. Removal from Tier 2 eligibility (repeat issues)

## Commission Comparison: SI8 vs. Industry

| Model | Platform/Agency | Creator Gets | Platform/Agency Keeps |
|-------|----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Stock Platforms** | | | |
| iStock (Getty) | Stock | 15%–20% | 80%–85% |
| Shutterstock | Stock | 15%–40% | 60%–85% |
| **SI8 Tier 1** | **Stock** | **20%** | **80%** |
| | | | |
| **Production/Agency** | | | |
| Traditional Talent Agency | Rep | 80%–90% | 10%–20% |
| Production Company Split | Co-production | 50%–60% | 40%–50% |
| **SI8 Tier 2** | **Production Partner** | **50%** | **50%** |

**Key positioning:**
- SI8 Tier 1 = competitive with premium stock (20% vs. iStock's 15–20%)
- SI8 Tier 2 = fair production split (50% is industry standard for co-production)

## Adjustments & Future Considerations

### Potential Tier 1 Adjustments (After Year 1)
- **Volume bonus:** 25% royalty after 10 assets in catalog
- **Exclusive program:** 30% royalty if creator commits to SI8-exclusive submissions
- **Performance tier:** Higher royalty for top-performing assets (e.g., assets that license 5+ times)

### Potential Tier 2 Adjustments
- **Base fee standardization:** Set standard rates for simple/moderate/complex projects
- **Rush fee:** +20% for <7 day turnaround
- **Revision caps:** 2 rounds included, $500 per additional round (billed to buyer, split 50/50)

### Platform Evolution (Year 3+)
If SI8 becomes a self-serve platform:
- Automated royalty calculations
- Monthly creator dashboards (see earnings, downloads, buyer geography)
- Tiered creator programs (Bronze/Silver/Gold based on performance)

## Open Questions (v1.0)

- [ ] Should we offer upfront advances for high-value creators? (e.g., $1,000 advance against future royalties)
- [ ] Should Tier 2 include a "First Right of Refusal" clause? (SI8 gets first shot at placement deals before creator pitches elsewhere)
- [ ] Should we cap Tier 1 royalties per asset? (e.g., max $5,000 lifetime royalties per asset before renegotiation)
- [ ] Should we offer higher splits for filmmaker-sourced deals? (e.g., if creator brings buyer, 30% royalty instead of 20%)
