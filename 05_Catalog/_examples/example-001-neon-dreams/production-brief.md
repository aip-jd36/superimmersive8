## 4. Human Authorship Declaration

**Statement of Creative Direction and Human Authorship (287 words):**

I conceptualized "Neon Dreams" as a visual exploration of solitude and memory in a hyper-commercialized future cityscape. The creative vision was entirely mine: the cyberpunk aesthetic, the rain-soaked mood, the color palette (neon pinks and blues), and the thematic focus on a lone wanderer.

The production involved extensive iteration and editorial control at every stage:

**Prompting Strategy:**
I wrote 47 individual prompts across 8 scenes, each tailored to specific visual goals. For the opening wide shot, I iterated 12 times before achieving the exact balance of neon intensity and atmospheric depth I wanted. Each prompt specified camera movement (slow push-in, handheld drift), lighting direction (backlit neon, rim lighting), and compositional framing (rule of thirds, leading lines through alleyways).

**Shot Selection and Curation:**
Runway generated approximately 180 video clips across the production period. I selected 23 clips that matched my vision and discarded the rest. Selection criteria included: visual coherence with the established aesthetic, motion quality (avoiding AI artifacts), and emotional tone (melancholic, not dystopian).

**Editorial Choices:**
In post-production, I made all creative decisions: pacing (slower cuts for contemplative mood vs. faster cuts during neon-dense sequences), color grading adjustments (pushing magentas in highlights, crushing blacks in shadows), and audio layering (timing ElevenLabs breaths to specific visual beats). The final 90-second runtime was deliberately structured as a three-act mood piece: Arrival → Immersion → Departure.

**Intentional Design:**
The character's wardrobe (dark coat, reflective surfaces), the presence of holographic advertisements (designed to allow future brand integration), and the rain effect intensity were all deliberate creative choices I directed through prompting, curation, and post-production refinement.

This work reflects my creative vision executed through AI tools, not automated AI output.

## 5. Likeness & Identity Confirmation

**Checklist:**
- ✓ No real person faces used or imitated
- ✓ No real person voices used or cloned
- ✓ No lookalikes or synthetic versions of real individuals
- ✓ All faces are AI-generated, non-identifiable synthetic humans
- ✓ All voices are AI-generated, non-specific synthetic voices

**Additional Notes:**
The character's face is intentionally obscured in most shots (hood, shadows, back-to-camera angles). The few visible facial moments show a generic AI-generated face with no resemblance to real individuals.

## 6. IP & Brand Confirmation

**Checklist:**
- ✓ No copyrighted characters imitated
- ✓ No recognizable brand imitation or trademarked IP
- ✓ No protected trade dress replicated
- ✓ All signage and branding is fictional/AI-generated

**Additional Notes:**
Neon signage shows abstract symbols and fictional Asian characters (non-language). No real brand logos appear. Holographic advertisements show geometric patterns, intentionally designed as placeholder elements for future brand integration via Tier 2 product placement.

**Audio Elements:**
- Ambient city sounds (rain, distant traffic): AI-generated via ElevenLabs sound effects
