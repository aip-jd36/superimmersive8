## 3. Rights Verified Sign-off

**Reviewer:** SI8 Review Team
**Review Date:** February 17, 2026
**Risk Tier Assigned:** **STANDARD**
**Review Duration:** 73 minutes

**Rights Verified Status:** ✓ **APPROVED FOR CATALOG**

**Review Summary:**
"Neon Dreams" passed Rights Verified review with no flags or conditions. The work demonstrates clear human creative direction (47 prompts, extensive iteration documented, editorial choices in post-production). All AI tools used under paid commercial plans. No copyrighted IP, real person likeness, or brand imitation detected. Audio is entirely AI-generated under authorized commercial use terms. Content is brand-safe for mainstream commercial attachment.

**Notable Strengths:**
- Exceptional documentation of human authorship (287-word declaration with specific creative decisions)
- Production process screenshots provide clear chain of custody
- Modification authorization covers holographic ad placements (strong Tier 2 potential)
- Visual style is distinctive and ownable (no derivative character imitation)

**No List Compliance:**
- ✓ No celebrity likeness or real person faces without consent
- ✓ No voice cloning of real people
- ✓ No copyrighted character imitation (e.g., recognizable IP)
- ✓ No brand IP imitation (all signage fictional/AI-generated)
- ✓ No political persuasion content

**Risk Tier Rationale:**
Assigned **Standard** tier (not Certified) because primary generation tool is Runway Gen-3 (paid commercial plan), not Adobe Firefly.

Work is suitable for mainstream brand licensing with appropriate legal review by buyer's counsel.
