# Example 001 — Neon Dreams: Design Notes

**Created:** February 21, 2026
**Purpose:** First Chain of Title example for sales, filmmaker onboarding, and internal reference

---

## Why This Example

**Strategic objectives:**
1. **Demonstrate both Tier 1 and Tier 2 eligibility** — Shows as-is licensing AND product placement authorization
2. **Show "clean pass" through Rights Verified** — No edge cases, no red flags, ideal submission
3. **Realistic but achievable** — Based on actual Runway Gen-3 capabilities and real filmmaker workflows
4. **Brand-safe and commercially viable** — Appeals to mainstream buyers (tech, automotive, streaming)
5. **Clear documentation standard** — Sets the bar for filmmaker submissions

---

## Content Choice Rationale

**Why cyberpunk/sci-fi aesthetic:**
- ✓ Naturally accommodates brand integration (neon signage, holographic ads are genre-native)
- ✓ Visually distinctive and ownable (not generic stock footage)
- ✓ Appeals to high-value buyer categories (tech brands, automotive, streaming platforms)
- ✓ Avoids real-world location IP issues (fictional cityscape)
- ✓ Cultural neutrality (abstract future aesthetic works globally)

**Why 90-second runtime:**
- ✓ Long enough to show narrative structure and production value
- ✓ Short enough for commercial use (60s + 30s cutdowns possible)
- ✓ Standard format for streaming platform "shorts" and ambient content
- ✓ Demonstrates sustained creative vision, not just single-shot experiments

**Why dialogue-free:**
- ✓ Eliminates script copyright questions
- ✓ Global licensing flexibility (no translation needed)
- ✓ Easier to demonstrate "human authorship" through visual choices vs. dialogue writing
- ✓ Reduces audio rights complexity

---

## Tool Stack Rationale

**Why Runway Gen-3 as primary tool:**
- ✓ Most commonly used AI video tool among serious creators (as of Feb 2026)
- ✓ Paid commercial plan authorization is clear and well-documented
- ✓ Represents "Standard" tier (not Certified/Firefly-only, not high-risk/prohibited)
- ✓ Demonstrates SI8's positioning: "Best creative tools made safe" (not just Adobe Firefly)

**Why ElevenLabs for audio:**
- ✓ Shows multi-tool production workflow (common in real productions)
- ✓ Creator Plan commercial use authorization is clear
- ✓ Demonstrates audio rights consideration (often overlooked by filmmakers)
- ✓ Non-verbal audio avoids script/voice cloning complexity

**Why Adobe Premiere in the stack:**
- ✓ Shows human editorial control in post-production (not just raw AI output)
- ✓ Reinforces "human authorship" narrative
- ✓ Realistic workflow (most filmmakers edit AI-generated clips in traditional NLEs)

## Documentation Design Decisions

### Production Brief (Filmmaker Submission)

**287-word Human Authorship Declaration:**
- Deliberately detailed to set high standard for filmmaker submissions
- Shows specific creative decisions (prompting strategy, shot selection, editorial choices)
- Quantifies iteration (47 prompts, 180 clips generated, 23 selected)
- Demonstrates "considerable effort" for innocent infringer defense (legal research finding)
- Exceeds 150-word minimum requirement in SI8 Filmmaker Agreement

**Modification Rights Authorization:**
- Clear "yes" with specific scope (signage, holograms, billboards)
- Shows filmmaker understands and authorizes Tier 2 product placement
- Includes reasonable approval checkpoint (filmmaker review of brand integration)
- Demonstrates category-exclusive preference (realistic filmmaker position)

**Supporting Materials:**
- Production process screenshots (12 images) — shows documentation is achievable, not burdensome
- Receipts for all paid tools — demonstrates compliance verification
- Full prompt log available on request — shows transparency without overwhelming submission

### Chain of Title (SI8 Deliverable)

**Risk Tier Assignment: Standard (not Certified):**
- Intentionally chose Runway (not Adobe Firefly) to demonstrate Standard tier
- Shows SI8's market positioning: "Best creative tools (Sora/Runway/Kling) made safe"
- Differentiates from Adobe's Certified tier (Firefly-only)
- Realistic for Year 1 catalog (most filmmakers use Runway/Pika/Sora, not Firefly)

**Regeneration Rights (Field 8):**
- Detailed breakdown of what can vs. cannot be regenerated
- Shows Tier 2 product placement mechanics clearly
- 30% screen time cap prevents brand overwhelm (reasonable guardrail)
- Demonstrates filmmaker creative control preservation

**Risk Mitigation Summary:**
- Added "For Buyer Legal Counsel" section to address sophisticated buyers
- Clear disclaimer: "Not legal advice or warranty" (critical for SI8 liability management)
- Three-tier risk framework (low/medium/higher) helps buyers self-assess
- Recommended actions guide buyers without creating liability

## What This Example Demonstrates

### For Filmmakers (Sales Tool)
- ✓ "Here's what you need to provide" → production-brief.md shows attainable documentation standard
- ✓ "Here's what you'll get in return" → chain-of-title shows professional, valuable documentation
- ✓ "Your work is valued and protected" → modification rights require authorization, approval checkpoint included
- ✓ "Clear path to commercial opportunity" → Tier 1 + Tier 2 eligibility explained

### For Buyers (Sales Tool)
- ✓ "This is what legal documentation looks like" → 9-field Chain of Title is comprehensive and defensible
- ✓ "We've done the homework" → Rights Verified review, TOS verification, No List compliance
- ✓ "Clear licensing options" → Tier 1 as-is vs. Tier 2 product placement differentiated
- ✓ "Risk mitigation framework" → helps legal counsel assess and approve
- ✓ "Professional operation" → demonstrates SI8's expertise and thoroughness

### For Internal Use
- ✓ Template for actual catalog entries (copy structure, adapt content)
- ✓ Standard for filmmaker submissions (this is the quality bar)
- ✓ Training material for future SI8 reviewers
- ✓ Proof of concept for 9-field schema (all fields populated with realistic content)

## Edge Cases Deliberately Avoided

**What this example does NOT demonstrate:**
- ❌ Conditional approval (this is a clean pass)
- ❌ Caution-tier tools (e.g., Kling) — saved for future example
- ❌ Music rights complexity (intentionally silent)
- ❌ Multi-filmmaker collaboration (single creator)
- ❌ Existing licensing conflicts (clean slate)
- ❌ Geographic restrictions (global rights)
- ❌ No modification authorization (Tier 1 only) — saved for Example 002

**Why avoided:**
This first example needs to show the "ideal path" — what a strong submission looks like, what clean approval looks like, what comprehensive documentation looks like. Edge cases will be demonstrated in Examples 002, 003, etc.

---

## Future Example Roadmap

Based on gaps in Example 001, future examples should demonstrate:

**Example 002: Narrative Short (Tier 1 Only)**
- Sora as primary tool (different tool stack)
- No modification authorization (filmmaker retains full creative control)
- Shows Tier 1-only licensing path
- Licensed music (demonstrates audio rights complexity)

**Example 003: Product Demo with Kling**
- Kling as primary tool (Caution tier) — shows how SI8 handles non-US tools
- Demonstrates category conflict log (existing license creates exclusivity)
- Territory restrictions (e.g., licensed exclusively in Asia-Pacific)
- Shows Tier 2 product placement as primary use case

**Example 004: Conditional Approval**
- Submission that required additional documentation before approval
- Shows revision request and filmmaker response
- Demonstrates Rights Verified edge case handling
- Re-review after modifications

---

## Lessons from Creating This Example

**What worked well:**
- 9-field schema is comprehensive but not overwhelming
- Production brief format is clear and filmmaker-friendly
- Chain of Title reads as professional and legally rigorous
- Both documents can realistically be produced in under 90 minutes (reviewer time target)

**What needs iteration:**
- Consider adding "Quick Reference" summary page to Chain of Title (1-page executive summary)
- Risk Mitigation Summary might be too detailed — test with real buyers
- Field 6 (Category Conflict Log) needs clearer formatting for active restrictions (currently "None" — will be complex with real catalog)
- Version History table (Field 9) will grow quickly — consider separating into appendix after 10+ entries

**Open questions:**
- Should Chain of Title be PDF or Markdown for buyer delivery? (Markdown for now, PDF conversion later)
- Do buyers want shorter version (5 pages) or comprehensive version (current 12 pages)? Test in sales conversations.
- Should SI8 offer "Chain of Title Lite" for low-risk use cases (e.g., editorial, internal use)? TBD.
- How to handle Chain of Title updates when tool ToS changes affect 100+ catalog entries? Need system for bulk updates.

## How to Use This Example

**In sales conversations:**
- **Email/LinkedIn:** "Here's an example of the Chain of Title documentation we provide with every license."
- **Discovery calls:** Screen-share the Chain of Title, walk through 9 fields
- **Proposals:** Attach as Appendix A: "Sample Chain of Title"

**For filmmaker onboarding:**
- **Initial outreach:** "Here's what documentation you'll receive when we represent your work"
- **Agreement negotiation:** "Production brief shows what we need from you; Chain of Title shows what you get in return"
- **Submission:** "Use the production brief format as your submission template"

**On website:**
- Add to Rights Verified section: "Download Sample Chain of Title" (gated, lead gen)
- Add thumbnail/preview to catalog page: "Each catalog entry includes comprehensive Chain of Title"
- Use in "How It Works" explainer

**Internal training:**
- Use as onboarding material for future SI8 team members
- Reference when reviewing actual filmmaker submissions ("Does this meet the Neon Dreams standard?")
- Template for populating actual catalog entry Chain of Titles

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Test with 2-3 trusted advisors (get feedback on clarity, comprehensiveness, legal rigor)
2. Share with Taipei filmmaker as example before his submission
3. Add to website as downloadable sample (gated lead gen asset)
4. Use in first buyer pitch (MyVideo proposal or Singapore agency outreach)
5. Iterate based on real feedback

**Version 1.0 Status:** Ready for external use (Feb 21, 2026)
