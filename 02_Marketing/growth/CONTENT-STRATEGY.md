# Content Marketing & Growth Strategy

**Version:** v0.1 (February 2026)
**Owner:** SI8
**Status:** Active — building toward first newsletter issue (Month 2)

---

## Strategic Purpose

SI8 needs to create the market it's selling into. Most brands don't know they have a problem with AI content risk yet. Most filmmakers don't know about Netflix's production requirements, YouTube's demonetization rules, or what a commercial license from Runway actually does and doesn't cover.

Content marketing is the most efficient way to build that awareness at scale — and it serves both of SI8's target audiences simultaneously:
- **Brands** need to understand *why they're exposed* and what a documented vetting process actually gives them
- **Filmmakers** need to understand *what makes their work commercially viable* and how to prepare it correctly

The long-term goal: SI8 becomes the authoritative source on AI content rights in APAC, the way Getty is the authority on image rights globally. Content builds institutional credibility that cold outreach cannot.

---

## The Core Constraint

**Content marketing cannot exceed 2 hours/week in Year 1.**

The outreach budget — 5 hours/week minimum — cannot be cannibalized by content creation. If forced to choose between writing a newsletter issue and sending 50 outreach messages, send the messages. The newsletter builds the brand over 12 months. Outreach pays the bills in Month 3.

This constraint determines every format and cadence decision below.

---

## Content Formats

### 1. Risk Briefing Page (Website)
**What:** A curated, regularly updated page on the SI8 website summarizing the current AI content legal and platform risk landscape. 6-8 entries, each with a brief SI8 commentary and source link. Framing: "We track this so you don't have to."

**Purpose:** SEO surface, credibility signal, and the primary reason first-time visitors bookmark the site and return.

**Update cadence:** When something significant happens — roughly monthly/quarterly. Not a news feed.

**Critical design note:** A "Last Updated: [Month Year]" timestamp must be visible. Stale "recent news" is worse than no news section at all.

**Lead magnet tie-in:** "Stay current — get Risk Briefing updates by email" is the email signup CTA on this page.

---

### 2. Email Newsletter
**What:** Monthly newsletter covering AI content rights developments. Two audiences, one newsletter — clearly labeled sections ("For Brands" / "For Filmmakers").

**Format:**
- One major legal development, explained in plain English (not dry legal recap)
- One platform policy update (YouTube, TikTok, Meta, Netflix, streaming)
- One SI8 insight, resource, or case study
- 400-600 words maximum
- Tone: expert narrator, not academic. SI8 as the underwriter who reads the filings so you don't have to.

**Cadence:** Monthly in Year 1. Weekly is not sustainable at 10-15 hrs/week.

**Platform options (decide before Month 2):**
- **Buttondown** — cleanest, simplest, no fluff. Good for text-forward newsletters.
- **Beehiiv** — built for growth, has referral mechanics and analytics. Better if list growth is the priority.
- **ConvertKit** — better automation/segmentation. Better if email sequences (for filmmakers vs. brands) are important.
- **Mailchimp** — most familiar but bloated for this use case.
- **Recommendation:** Beehiiv for Year 1 if growth is the priority; Buttondown if simplicity is.

**Bilingual plan:** Launch in English. Add zh-TW edition when Taipei outreach ramps (Month 2-3). Do not delay English launch for bilingual readiness.

### 3. White Papers & Rights Guides
**What:** Long-form, downloadable content. Gated behind email signup.

**The key insight:** The white papers already exist. Do not create new content. Package what's built:
- **Rights Playbook v0.1** → packaged as "AI Video Rights: A Brand's Guide" (PDF)
- **Safe Lane documentation** → packaged as "How to Submit AI Films for Commercial Use" (filmmaker-facing PDF)
- **Risk landscape research** → packaged as "The AI Content Risk Briefing 2026" (brand-facing PDF)

**Future white papers** are byproducts of client work — after the first real submission, the learnings become content. After the MyVideo conversation, the Taiwan platform requirements become a guide. Do not create content speculatively.

---

### 4. Lead Magnets
**What:** Gated downloads that justify email signup.

**Priority lead magnets (in order of effort required to produce):**
1. **"AI Video Rights: A Brand's Guide"** — Rights Playbook repackaged for brand audience. Exists, needs light reformatting. Highest-leverage first action.
2. **"Platform Requirements Cheatsheet"** — One-page summary of YouTube, TikTok, Meta, Netflix AI requirements, in table form. Can be produced in 1-2 hours from existing research.
3. **"Safe Lane Submission Guide for Filmmakers"** — Submission Requirements doc lightly reformatted. Filmmaker-facing.

---

### 5. Social / LinkedIn
**What:** Build-in-public content driving traffic to website and newsletter.
**Home:** `02_Marketing/content/social/BUILD_IN_PUBLIC_LOG.md`
**Cadence:** 2-3 posts/week
**Strategy:** Each newsletter issue → 2-3 LinkedIn posts. Each white paper → 1 launch post + 2-3 excerpts. Each major legal case → immediate post. Content compounds from newsletter into social, not the other way around.

| Brand legal/compliance | "What documentation do we need to use this commercially?" | Rights Package schema, Safe Lane process, regulatory deadlines | Download rights guide |
| Agency creative leads | "What tools can we use and what do we need to document?" | Platform requirements, tool risk tiers, indemnification gap | Newsletter signup |
| AI filmmakers (commercial) | "How do I make my work licensable to brands?" | Safe Lane submission guide, platform requirements for creators | Submit your work / newsletter |
| AI filmmakers (hobbyists) | "What are the rules?" | YouTube/TikTok/Netflix requirements, authorship basics | Newsletter signup |
