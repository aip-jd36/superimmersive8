# Content Marketing & Growth Strategy

**Version:** v0.2 (February 2026)
**Owner:** SI8
**Status:** Active — decisions finalized, execution beginning

---

## Strategic Purpose

SI8 needs to create the market it's selling into. Most brands don't know they have a problem with AI content risk. Content marketing is the mechanism — but it serves outreach, it doesn't replace it.

**Mental model:** Content is outreach ammunition and a compounding asset. Not a flywheel that builds toward some future state. A lead magnet is the "give" in a cold email. A newsletter is what makes the second and third contact feel useful, not pushy. The website explainers build SEO that works in Month 12. All of it serves the 5 hours/week of outreach that closes deals now.

**Long-term goal:** SI8 becomes the authoritative source on AI content rights in APAC — the way Getty is the authority on image rights globally.

---

## Core Constraints

**Content production: 2 hours/week ceiling in Year 1.**
Outreach (5 hrs/week) is protected and cannot be cannibalized. AI-drafted content + founder redraft is the production model — not from-scratch writing.

**Outreach time is primary. Content time is secondary.** If forced to choose, send the outreach.

---

## Audience Focus

**Year 1: Brands and agencies only.**
Newsletter, explainers, and lead magnets target brand marketing directors, agency creative leads, and brand legal/compliance teams. This is where the revenue is.

**Filmmakers:** Not a content marketing target in Year 1. Filmmaker acquisition is direct outreach (DMs on LinkedIn, Twitter, Discord). The Rights Verified documentation on the website serves as passive filmmaker education. A filmmaker signup path exists but is not actively promoted through content.

**Year 2+:** Filmmaker-focused content section added to newsletter once brand content infrastructure is stable and catalog supply needs to scale.

## The Five Content Pillars

### 1. Website Evergreen Explainers (Primary SEO Asset)

**What:** Standalone pages on the SI8 website that answer specific questions brands and agencies search for. Not news entries — evergreen content that ranks for 12+ months.

**Format per explainer:**
- Headline that matches a search query
- 400-600 words
- SI8 commentary, not dry legal summary
- One CTA: email signup to download the lead magnet or book a Risk Triage Call
- One visual: curated example of quality AI video content

**Topics — Month 1 (4 explainers, using existing research):**
1. "Does Runway's commercial license actually protect your brand?" — the indemnification gap
2. "YouTube, TikTok, Meta, Netflix: what each platform actually requires for AI content" — platform compliance
3. "Why 'I paid for the tool' isn't a legal defense" — training data, fair use, and the Copyright Office's 2025 ruling
4. "AI content disclosure deadlines: what's changing in 2026 and what brands need to do now" — regulatory calendar

**Cadence:** 4 in Month 1. 2/month from Month 2 onward.

**Production model:** AI draft → founder redraft → publish. All source material already exists in `01_Business/research/ai-content-risk-landscape.md`.

**Distribution:** Each explainer → 1 LinkedIn post or carousel the same week.

---

### 2. LinkedIn Distribution (Immediate Reach)

**What:** LinkedIn posts and carousels that distribute explainer content and drive traffic to the website and newsletter signup.

**Format:** Mix of carousels (6-8 slides, one legal case or platform rule per carousel) and short-form posts. Every post pairs legal/risk content with a visual example of quality AI video (sourced publicly until catalog exists).

**Cadence:** 2 posts/week. Not 3 — not sustainable at 10-15 hrs/week.

**Content source:** Newsletter issue → 2 LinkedIn posts. Each explainer → 1 LinkedIn post or carousel. Major legal case or platform update → immediate reactive post.

---

### 3. Monthly Newsletter

**What:** Brand-only email newsletter. One issue/month. 250-350 words.

**Audience:** Brands, agencies, brand legal/compliance. NOT filmmakers in Year 1.

**Format (rigid template — do not deviate):**
- **Subject line:** One specific fact or case name. Never "Monthly Update."
- **Lede (2-3 sentences):** What happened. Why it matters to the reader's budget or legal team.
- **The implication (2-3 sentences):** What brands/agencies should do differently.
- **CTA (1-2 sentences):** One link. One ask. Alternates between: book a Risk Triage Call / download the lead magnet / read the latest explainer.

**Cadence:** Monthly. If a month is missed, skip it — don't catch up. Consistency over volume.

**Platform:** ConvertKit. Tag all subscribers at signup: `brand_buyer` or `filmmaker`. Default send is brand-only. Filmmaker tag exists for future segmentation.

**Signup flow:** Two buttons on the newsletter signup page — "I'm a Brand / Agency" → `brand_buyer` tag. "I'm a Filmmaker" → `filmmaker` tag. Same list, different tags.

**Bilingual:** English only until Taiwan/MyVideo pipeline is demonstrably active. One zh-TW lead magnet PDF for Taipei conversations.

### 4. Lead Magnets (Email Capture)

**What:** Gated PDF downloads that justify email signup and serve as cold email "give."

**Priority pipeline:**

| # | Title | Audience | Source | Status |
|---|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | "AI Video Rights: A Brand's Guide" | Brands/agencies | Rights Playbook + risk research | To produce |
| 2 | "What Your Legal Team Will Ask For: AI Video Compliance Checklist" | Brand legal/compliance | Chain of Title schema + research | To produce (Month 2) |
| 3 | "Platform Requirements Cheatsheet" | Brands + agencies | Platform research | To produce (Month 2) |
| 4 | "Rights Verified Submission Guide for Filmmakers" | Filmmakers | Submission Requirements doc | To produce (Month 3+) |

**Lead magnet #1 rationale:** "AI Video Rights: A Brand's Guide" is broad evergreen content — the right first asset for a blue ocean market where buyers need education before they need specifics. More targeted assets (legal team checklist, etc.) come once the audience understands the category.

**Cold email use:** Lead magnet #1 is the "give" in outbound outreach emails to Singapore agencies. Link to download in the email, before any ask.

---

### 5. Risk Triage Call (Conversion Mechanism)

**What:** Productized 20-minute call. Replaces the generic "book a call" CTA across all content.

**Offer:** "20-Minute AI Video Risk Triage"
- Buyer brings: a link to sample AI content they want to use commercially, or a brief description of a campaign
- SI8 outputs: risk flags, what documentation is missing, recommended next step
- CTA afterward: Tier 1 license, Tier 2 placement, or Tier 3 advisory conversation

**Why this matters:** Without a specific conversion mechanism, content builds awareness with no floor. The Risk Triage Call turns newsletter readers and explainer visitors into conversations. It's low-friction for a risk-averse buyer because the output is specific and useful, not a sales pitch.

**Implementation:** Update Calendly link name and description. This CTA goes on every piece of content — newsletter footer, explainer pages, LinkedIn bio, website homepage.
