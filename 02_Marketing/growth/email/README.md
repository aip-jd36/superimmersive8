# Email List Management

## Platform Decision (TBD before Month 2)
Options:
- **Beehiiv** — built for growth, referral mechanics, strong analytics. Best if list growth is priority.
- **Buttondown** — simple, clean, text-forward. Best if simplicity is priority.
- **ConvertKit** — best for segmentation/automation (brands vs. filmmakers). More setup.
- **Mailchimp** — familiar but bloated for this use case.

## Segments (eventual)
- Brands (marketing directors, legal/compliance)
- Filmmakers (commercial)
- Filmmakers (hobbyist/emerging)
- Agency leads

## Sequences (to build)
- Welcome sequence (3 emails): what SI8 is, what the Safe Lane is, first resource
- Filmmaker onboarding: Safe Lane process, submission requirements
- Brand onboarding: risk landscape, indemnification gap, Rights Package explainer
