# SEO Research & Keyword Strategy

## Target Keyword Clusters (initial)
- AI video commercial license / commercial rights
- Runway AI copyright / Runway commercial use
- YouTube AI content policy / YouTube AI disclosure
- AI video brand safe / brand safety AI content
- AI film distribution / AI film rights
- Netflix AI production guidelines
- AI content risk / AI content legal risk

## Content → SEO mapping
Each white paper and risk briefing entry should target at least one keyword cluster.
Risk Briefing page = primary SEO surface for legal/risk terms.
White papers = primary SEO surface for rights/licensing terms.

## Notes
- Bilingual SEO: zh-TW keyword research needed for Taiwan market (Month 2-3)
- Long-tail opportunity: very little quality content exists in Traditional Chinese on AI video rights
