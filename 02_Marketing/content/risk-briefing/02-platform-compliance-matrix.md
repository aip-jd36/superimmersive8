# YouTube, TikTok, Meta, Netflix: what each platform actually requires for AI content

**Last Updated:** February 2026

**TL;DR:** Every major platform has different AI content disclosure rules. Using the same AI video across platforms without adjusting metadata can get you flagged or removed.

## Why Platform Compliance Matters

You might think: *"I paid for the tool, I own the output, I can post it anywhere."*

**Wrong.**

Platforms don't care if you own the copyright. They care about:
- Disclosure (did you label it as AI?)
- Authenticity (could it mislead viewers?)
- Rights documentation (can you prove it's yours to upload?)

Violate a platform's AI content policy → your video gets removed, your account gets flagged, or your campaign gets killed mid-flight.

## Platform Compliance Matrix

### YouTube (Google)

**Disclosure required:** Yes — creators must check the "altered or synthetic content" box when uploading.

**When required:**
- Realistic scenes that didn't happen (e.g., AI-generated cityscapes, product demos)
- AI-generated people (even if fictional)
- Voice cloning or deepfakes

**Enforcement:** YouTube adds an automated label: *"Altered or synthetic content"* below the video title. If you don't disclose and YouTube detects it, they can remove the video and issue a strike.

**Documentation required:** None publicly, but YouTube reserves the right to request proof of rights/permissions.

**Key risk:** AI-generated content that *looks* real without disclosure = policy violation.

---

### TikTok

**Disclosure required:** Yes — AI-generated or AI-edited content must be labeled.

**When required:**
- Realistic AI-generated images, video, or audio
- AI voice cloning or face swaps
- AI tools used for realistic scene generation

**Enforcement:** TikTok automatically adds a label: *"AI-generated"* to flagged content. Users who repeatedly fail to disclose can be shadowbanned or suspended.

**Documentation required:** None publicly, but brands running TikTok ads with AI content must provide proof of rights and disclose AI use in ad creative.

**Key risk:** TikTok's algorithm heavily penalizes undisclosed AI content in For You recommendations.

### Meta (Facebook / Instagram)

**Disclosure required:** Yes — since December 2023, Meta requires AI-generated content to be labeled.

**When required:**
- Photorealistic AI images or video
- AI-generated audio (voice cloning)
- AI face filters that alter identity

**Enforcement:** Meta uses C2PA/Content Credentials to auto-detect AI content. If detected and not disclosed, Meta adds *"Made with AI"* label automatically. Repeat violations = account restrictions.

**Documentation required:** For branded content and ads, Meta may request documentation proving you have rights to use AI outputs commercially.

**Key risk:** Meta's C2PA detection is aggressive — even if your content is *mostly* human-made but uses AI for one element, it may get flagged.

---

### Netflix

**Disclosure required:** Yes — all content submitted to Netflix must disclose AI usage in production.

**When required:**
- Any AI-generated video, audio, or visual effects
- AI editing tools (e.g., rotoscoping, color grading)
- AI-assisted scriptwriting or storyboarding (if material to final output)

**Enforcement:** Netflix reviews all submissions manually. Failure to disclose AI usage in production notes = rejection. Misrepresentation = termination of distribution agreement.

**Documentation required:** Full production notes, including:
- Which tools were used (tool name, version, plan type)
- What was AI-generated vs. human-created
- Rights documentation for all AI outputs
- Training data disclosure (if available)

**Key risk:** Netflix has the strictest AI disclosure requirements of any platform. If you can't document your production process, Netflix won't accept it.

## What Happens If You Don't Comply?

| Platform | First Violation | Repeat Violations | Permanent Ban Risk |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **YouTube** | Warning + video removal | Strike (3 strikes = channel suspension) | High |
| **TikTok** | Shadowban (reduced reach) | Account suspension | Medium |
| **Meta** | Auto-label applied | Reduced distribution, ad account restrictions | Medium |
| **Netflix** | Submission rejection | Distribution agreement termination | High |
