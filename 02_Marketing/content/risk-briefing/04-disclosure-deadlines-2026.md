# AI content disclosure deadlines: what's changing in 2026 and what brands need to do now

**Last Updated:** February 2026

**TL;DR:** Four major jurisdictions are implementing mandatory AI disclosure laws in 2026. If you're running AI-generated content campaigns in South Korea, Taiwan, New York, or the EU, you need to comply — or face fines.

---

## Why This Matters Now

For the past two years, AI content disclosure was *optional* — platforms like YouTube and TikTok encouraged it, but enforcement was light.

**That's over.**

Starting in 2026, governments are imposing **mandatory disclosure requirements** with **financial penalties** for non-compliance. If your brand is running campaigns with AI-generated content in these regions, you need to update your workflows *before* these deadlines hit.

## Regulatory Deadline Grid

| Jurisdiction | Effective Date | What's Required | Penalty for Non-Compliance |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **South Korea** | January 15, 2026 | All AI-generated or AI-edited content used in advertising must include visible disclosure ("AI-generated" label or equivalent) | Fines up to ₩50M (~$37K USD) per violation |
| **Taiwan** | December 31, 2025 | AI-generated content in political, news, or commercial contexts must be labeled. Includes advertising and branded content. | Fines up to NT$1M (~$32K USD); repeat violations = criminal liability |
| **New York (USA)** | June 1, 2026 | AI-generated content used in political advertising or brand campaigns must be disclosed in ad copy or metadata. Applies to all platforms (social, TV, digital). | Fines up to $5,000 per violation; repeat violations = campaign suspension |
| **European Union (AI Act)** | August 1, 2026 | AI-generated content in advertising, entertainment, or public communications must include machine-readable disclosure (C2PA/Content Credentials preferred). | Fines up to €30M or 6% of global revenue, whichever is higher |

## What "Disclosure" Actually Means

Each jurisdiction defines disclosure differently. Here's what compliance looks like:

### South Korea
- **Requirement:** Visible text overlay or end-card: *"This content was generated using artificial intelligence."*
- **Language:** Korean (한국어) required for Korean-language campaigns.
- **Placement:** Must be visible for at least 3 seconds in video content; must appear in image captions for static ads.

### Taiwan
- **Requirement:** Label must indicate AI use clearly in Traditional Chinese: *"本內容使用人工智慧生成"* (This content was generated using AI).
- **Placement:** Must be visible in the ad creative itself — not just in a linked disclaimer.
- **Exemption:** Purely decorative AI elements (e.g., AI color grading) do not require disclosure if human creative direction is primary.

### New York
- **Requirement:** AI disclosure must appear in ad copy or as a platform-supported label (e.g., YouTube's "Altered or synthetic content" checkbox).
- **Placement:** For TV/video ads, disclosure must be in the first 5 seconds or as an end-card.
- **Scope:** Applies to all AI-generated imagery, audio, or video used in advertising — including AI voiceovers, AI product demos, and AI-generated backgrounds.

### European Union
- **Requirement:** Machine-readable disclosure using C2PA/Content Credentials or equivalent metadata standard.
- **Placement:** Metadata must be embedded in the file itself (not just a caption). Platforms must preserve this metadata on upload.
- **Human authorship:** If the content is *primarily* human-created with minor AI assistance, disclosure may not be required — but the burden of proof is on the brand.

## What Brands Need to Do Right Now

**Step 1: Audit your current AI usage**
List all campaigns using AI-generated content. Which regions are they running in? Which tools were used? Is disclosure already in place?

**Step 2: Update your production workflows**
Ensure every AI-generated asset includes:
- Tool provenance (what was used)
- Human authorship documentation (how humans directed it)
- Disclosure metadata (C2PA/Content Credentials if possible)

**Step 3: Update your creative templates**
Add disclosure labels to video end-cards, image captions, and platform metadata fields. Make it part of your standard QA checklist.

**Step 4: Brief your legal team**
Share this briefing with your legal/compliance team. They need to know these deadlines exist.

**Step 5: Test compliance in one region first**
If you're running campaigns in multiple jurisdictions, pick the strictest one (EU or New York) and build compliance workflows there. Then replicate for other regions.
