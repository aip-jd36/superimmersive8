# Does Runway's commercial license actually protect your brand?

**Last Updated:** February 2026

**TL;DR:** No. Paying for Runway's commercial plan gives you a license to use what you create — but it doesn't protect you if what you created is infringing.

## The Indemnification Gap

Most AI video tools do NOT indemnify you against IP claims. Here's what that means in practice:

| Tool | Indemnification | What This Means |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Adobe Firefly** | ✅ Yes — Adobe defends you | If someone sues you for copyright infringement based on Firefly output, Adobe covers your legal costs and damages. |
| **Microsoft Designer** | ✅ Yes — Microsoft defends you | Full "Copilot Copyright Commitment" — Microsoft takes liability for IP claims. |
| **Runway** | ❌ No — you're on your own | Runway's ToS: "We provide no warranties regarding your use of outputs." You pay for access, not protection. |
| **Midjourney** | ❌ No — you're on your own | Midjourney v6 trained on copyrighted images without permission. You own the output, but if it's infringing, that's your problem. |
| **Kling AI** | ❌ No — you're on your own | Chinese jurisdiction. No indemnification. No recourse if a brand logo appears in your output. |

## Why This Matters Now

**December 2024:** Disney, Universal, and Warner Brothers filed a $300M lawsuit against Midjourney, Runway, and DeviantArt for training AI models on copyrighted film stills without permission.

**July 2024:** Internal Runway training data leaked — datasets included copyrighted YouTube videos, pirated films, and thousands of movie clips scraped without licensing.

**The problem:** If Runway loses this lawsuit, *every commercial user of Runway-generated content could be at risk*. Runway's ToS explicitly says they won't defend you.

## What "Commercial License" Actually Covers

When you pay for Runway's Pro plan ($35/month), you get:
- ✅ The right to use your generated videos commercially
- ✅ Copyright ownership of your prompts and edits
- ❌ NOT protection against IP infringement claims
- ❌ NOT indemnification if your video contains copyrighted elements
- ❌ NOT a guarantee the training data was legally obtained

**Translation:** You can sell what you make. But if what you make gets you sued, Runway is not responsible.

## How SI8 Fills the Gap

We can't make you lawsuit-proof (no one can). But we can significantly reduce the risk:

1. **Tool tier assessment** — Adobe Firefly = Certified (indemnified). Runway/Pika/Sora = Standard (not indemnified, but high-quality if used carefully).
2. **Rights Verified vetting** — Every production reviewed for IP imitation risk, likeness rights, brand safety.
3. **Chain of Title documentation** — Tool provenance, model versions, commercial use authorization, and SHA-256 file hash included with every catalog entry.
4. **Modification clause** — For Tier 2 placements, brand elements are AI-regenerated into existing productions — so your brand isn't attached to unknown-provenance content.
