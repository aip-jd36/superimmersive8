# Building SuperImmersive 8: The Journey

A running log of decisions, insights, and lessons learned while building an AI film distribution company.

*Last updated: January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

I'm building SuperImmersive 8 — an AI film distribution agency based in Taipei.

The thesis: AI-generated film is at an inflection point. Creators are producing stunning work, but there's no infrastructure for monetization or distribution. I'm building the picks and shovels.

**The Business:**
```
SuperImmersive 8
├── CORE: Distribution & Licensing Agency
│   └── Represent AI filmmakers, license their work
├── PIPELINE: AI Creators Fest
│   └── Events that source filmmakers + build brand
├── DEMAND: r/aifilmreviews
│   └── Build audience for AI film content
└── FUTURE: Actor Likeness Micro-Licensing
    └── Platform for actors to license to AI creators
```

This document tracks what I'm learning as I build.

## Insights & Decisions

### #1: The "Picks and Shovels" Positioning

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
Everyone's rushing to build AI creation tools or become AI filmmakers. But nobody's building the distribution layer.

In every gold rush, the sustainable businesses are often the ones selling picks and shovels — not the ones digging for gold.

For AI film, that means:
- Distribution & licensing (representing creators)
- Community & events (aggregating the ecosystem)
- Curation & discovery (connecting quality with buyers)

**Why it matters:**
This positioning lets me leverage my actual background (film production + distribution + events) rather than competing on AI/ML expertise I don't have.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "In the AI film gold rush, I'm not trying to mine gold — I'm selling picks and shovels.
>
> Everyone's building AI video tools or becoming AI filmmakers. Almost nobody is building the distribution infrastructure.
>
> That's the gap I'm filling with SuperImmersive 8."

### #2: Hybrid Positioning — Start Boutique, Scale Later

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
The temptation is to build a broad platform that serves everyone. But at this stage, credibility comes from curation.

The plan: start with a selective, boutique roster of represented filmmakers. Build reputation on quality. Then scale once the brand means something.

**Why it matters:**
- A curated roster signals quality to buyers
- Selective representation attracts better creators (exclusivity psychology)
- Easier to maintain quality control while learning the business

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "When you're building a new category, you can't be everything to everyone.
>
> Our strategy: start boutique, scale later.
>
> A small roster of exceptional AI filmmakers beats a massive database of mediocre content. Curation is our moat."

---

### #3: Two-Sided Marketplace = Two Value Props

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
The business serves two distinct audiences:
1. **AI Filmmakers** seeking monetization, legitimacy, and community
2. **Buyers** (streamers, educators, brands) seeking quality, legal clarity, and discovery

The website, messaging, and strategy must speak to both — without confusing either.

**Why it matters:**
Most marketplaces fail because they optimize for one side. We need both sides to see clear value immediately.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "Building a two-sided marketplace means writing two value propositions — not one.
>
> For filmmakers: 'Your work deserves professional representation.'
> For buyers: 'Curated AI content, clear licensing.'
>
> Same company. Two completely different pitches."

---

### #4: Events as Community Moat

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
AI Creators Fest isn't just a revenue stream — it's a community-building moat.

The plan:
- Start with small screening + networking meetups (30-50 people)
- Evolve to half-day conferences quarterly
- Build toward a flagship annual festival

Physical gatherings create relationships that online-only can't replicate. Whoever builds the community first has a lasting advantage.

**Why it matters:**
- Events build trust before transactions
- Creates natural pipeline for filmmaker recruitment
- Sponsors want access to engaged communities
- Press/media hook for awareness

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "In a world of AI everything, physical community is the moat.
>
> AI Creators Fest starts as a simple meetup — screenings and networking. But the goal is to become THE gathering point for AI filmmakers in Asia.
>
> Whoever aggregates the community first wins."

---

### #5: Taiwan as Strategic Base

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
Taipei is an underrated launchpad for this business:
- Bridge between Hollywood and China/Asia
- Strong tech ecosystem (talent, investment)
- Lower cost to experiment than LA or NYC
- Growing creative/cultural scene
- Personal network already established

**Why it matters:**
Starting in a smaller market means less competition, lower costs, and room to iterate before expanding globally.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "Why launch an AI film company in Taipei, not LA?
>
> Lower costs. Less competition. A bridge to all of Asia. And a tech ecosystem that understands what's coming.
>
> Sometimes the smartest move is starting where you have unfair advantages — not where the spotlight already is."

---

### #6: Events Are Pipeline, Not Product

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I initially thought of AI Creators Fest as a separate business line. Wrong framing.

The events are the *marketing and pipeline* for the core distribution business. They're how we:
- Discover filmmakers to represent
- Build brand visibility
- Create content for social proof
- Attract sponsors (who become partners)

The distribution business is the engine. Events are the fuel.

**Why it matters:**
This changes how I think about event economics. They don't need to be independently profitable — they need to generate enough filmmaker pipeline and brand equity to justify the cost.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "When I started planning AI Creators Fest, I thought of it as a revenue stream.
>
> Now I see it differently: events are the marketing arm for the distribution business.
>
> The real product is representation. Events are how we find the filmmakers worth representing."

---

### #7: The Legal Infrastructure is Non-Negotiable

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
Distribution is fundamentally a legal business. You can't represent filmmakers or license content without:
- Representation agreements (by region)
- Licensing templates (by buyer type: streamers, schools, festivals, brands)
- AI-specific clauses (training data warranties, likeness clearances, disclosure)

This isn't optional infrastructure — it's the core product.

**Why it matters:**
- Legal clarity is a key value prop to buyers (they can't license uncertain rights)
- AI content has unique legal complexity (copyright status, training data, deepfakes)
- Getting this right early = competitive moat

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "Here's what I've learned about AI film distribution: it's a legal business dressed as a creative one.
>
> The value we provide isn't just 'finding buyers' — it's providing legal clarity in a space full of uncertainty.
>
> Clean contracts, clear rights, defensible licensing. That's the product."

---

### #8: Create Demand, Not Just Supply

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
Everyone's focused on the supply side — more AI tools, more creators, more content. But who's building the *audience*?

For AI film to become a real medium, people need to watch it, discuss it, critique it. That's why I started r/aifilmreviews — treating AI films as worthy of serious review.

**Why it matters:**
- Legitimizes the medium (what gets reviewed, gets taken seriously)
- Builds audience familiarity and taste
- Creates discovery mechanism
- Positions SI8 as tastemaker, not just middleman

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "Everyone's building AI filmmaking tools. I'm building AI film audiences.
>
> I started r/aifilmreviews to review AI-generated films seriously — because what gets criticized gets legitimized.
>
> Supply without demand is just noise. Someone needs to create the viewers."

---

### #9: The Unsolved Problem — Actor Likeness Licensing

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
AI filmmakers need characters. Their options today:
1. Synthetic faces (uncanny, limited)
2. Celebrity licensing (expensive, inaccessible)
3. Unauthorized use (legally risky)

There's no "Shutterstock for actor likenesses" — no platform where actors can easily license their face/voice to indie creators at micro-transaction scale.

This is a future opportunity, not today's focus. But it's adjacent to everything SI8 is building.

**Why it matters:**
- Natural extension of filmmaker representation
- Solves real problem for our clients
- First-mover opportunity in nascent space

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "Here's a problem nobody's solving yet: actor likeness licensing for AI creators.
>
> Big studios negotiate bespoke deals. Indie creators have no legitimate pathway.
>
> Someone will build the 'Shutterstock for actor likenesses.' It might be us — but not yet."

---

### #10: The Competition is Real — And That's Good News

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I thought I was entering a green field. I wasn't.

After deep research, I found:
- **Escape.ai** — Founded by John Gaeta (The Matrix VFX legend). Neo-cinema distribution platform. Hollywood advisory board. Well-funded.
- **Curious Refuge** — 50,000+ AI filmmaker community. Just acquired by Promise (backed by Andreessen Horowitz).
- **10+ AI film festivals** already running globally (Runway AIFF, WAiFF, AI International Film Festival, etc.)

The space is forming. Fast.

**Why this is actually good:**
- Validates the market exists
- Creates category awareness (I don't have to explain "AI film" anymore)
- Forces me to sharpen positioning
- First mover in *Asia-Pacific* still holds — no serious regional competitor

**Why it matters:**
Competition means the opportunity is real. The question isn't "is there a market?" — it's "what's my defensible position?"

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I thought I was building in a green field. Then I did my competitor research.
>
> Escape.ai (Matrix VFX legend). Curious Refuge (50K community, a]16z-backed acquirer). 10+ AI film festivals globally.
>
> The space is forming fast. But here's the thing: competition validates the opportunity. The question isn't 'is there a market?' — it's 'what's my angle?'
>
> Mine: Asia-Pacific. Agency model. Legal infrastructure. Year-round community.
>
> Let the race begin."

---

### #11: Platform vs. Agency — A Critical Distinction

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
Escape.ai is a *platform*. Creators upload, set prices, self-monetize.

SI8 is an *agency*. We represent creators, broker deals, handle contracts.

These are fundamentally different businesses:

| Model | Platform (Escape.ai) | Agency (SI8) |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| Creator relationship | Transactional | Personal |
| Revenue | Transaction fees | Commission on deals |
| Value add | Infrastructure | Representation + deals |
| Scalability | High | Medium |
| Moat | Network effects | Relationships + expertise |

**Why it matters:**
- Platform model scales faster but commoditizes creators
- Agency model builds deeper relationships and can command higher-value deals
- In a new medium with uncertain value, personal representation may matter more than self-serve tools

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "Platform or agency? It's the fundamental question for any marketplace business.
>
> Platforms scale. Agencies build relationships.
>
> For AI film — a new medium with uncertain value and legal complexity — I'm betting on the agency model.
>
> Creators don't just need a place to upload. They need someone in their corner, navigating a confusing landscape.
>
> That's the bet."

---

### #12: The Festival Landscape is Crowded — So Don't Compete on Festivals

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I counted 10+ AI film festivals already operating:
- Runway AIFF (NYC/LA, prestigious)
- World AI Film Festival (Kyoto, São Paulo, Seoul, Cannes)
- AI International Film Festival (Hollywood, since 2021)
- 1 Billion Summit AI Film Award ($1M prize!)
- And more...

If AI Creators Fest tries to compete as "another AI film festival," we lose.

**The reframe:**
AI Creators Fest isn't a festival. It's a *community pipeline*.

- Festivals = annual competition, winners/losers, one-time interaction
- AI Creators Fest = ongoing relationship, year-round engagement, pathway to representation

**Why it matters:**
Don't compete where you can't win. Compete where you have advantage: regional focus (Taiwan/Asia), year-round relationship, integrated with distribution business.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "There are already 10+ AI film festivals globally. The Runway festival. WAiFF in Cannes. A $1M prize in Dubai.
>
> If I try to out-festival the festivals, I lose.
>
> So AI Creators Fest isn't a festival. It's a community pipeline.
>
> Festivals give you a trophy. We give you representation.
>
> That's the difference."

### #13: The Honest List of Ways This Could Fail

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I spent a session cataloging every way this business could fail. Not to be pessimistic — to be prepared.

**The 12 failure modes:**

1. **AI film never becomes a real medium** — stays a novelty forever
2. **Timing is wrong** — too early (no one's ready) or too late (competitors won)
3. **Buyers won't pay** — they see AI content as worthless or legally risky
4. **Filmmakers don't need us** — self-distribution works fine, 25% commission too high
5. **Legal rug-pull** — copyright rulings or regulations make AI content toxic
6. **We get crushed** — Escape.ai, Promise, or traditional agencies win
7. **Business model doesn't work** — deal sizes too small, volume too low
8. **Taiwan is wrong hub** — action stays in LA, we're geographically irrelevant
9. **Solo founder execution risk** — can't do everything needed
10. **Technology changes everything** — today's content is obsolete tomorrow
11. **AI stigma sticks** — reputation problem we can't shake
12. **Events fail to launch** — no attendance, no sponsors, no pipeline

**Most likely path to failure:**
Legal uncertainty + filmmakers don't need us + competition wins = stuck in small niche with deals too small to sustain.

**Why this exercise matters:**
- Forces clarity on what MUST go right
- Identifies kill switches (when to quit vs. pivot)
- Prevents wishful thinking
- Makes risk mitigation actionable

**What must go right:**
1. Someone pays real money for AI content (buyer validation)
2. Filmmakers actually want representation (supply validation)
3. Legal clarity emerges — or we become the "safe" option
4. Competition stays fragmented long enough
5. AI Creators Fest builds genuine community

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I made a list of 12 ways my startup could fail.
>
> Not pessimism. Preparation.
>
> The most likely path to failure: legal uncertainty makes buyers scared, filmmakers decide they don't need representation, and better-funded competitors win the market.
>
> So now I know what must go right:
> 1. Someone pays real money for AI content
> 2. Filmmakers actually want help
> 3. We move faster than the competition
>
> If those three things happen, we have a business. If not, we don't.
>
> Clarity is underrated."

---

### #14: Kill Switches — Knowing When to Quit

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
Most founders don't know when to quit. They either quit too early (before validation) or too late (after burning everything).

I'm setting explicit kill switches:

| Signal | Deadline | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| No buyer pays real money for AI content | Q3 2026 | Reassess entire thesis |
| Can't sign 3 filmmakers who want representation | Q2 2026 | Reassess value proposition |
| Major platform bans AI content | Anytime | Evaluate if market still exists |
| Escape.ai dominates Asia-Pacific | Anytime | Pivot to niche or exit |
| Zero event attendance despite promotion | Q2 2026 | Pivot away from events model |

**Why this matters:**
- Removes emotion from the "should I keep going?" question
- Conserves resources for pivots
- Forces honest evaluation
- Prevents sunk cost fallacy

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I set kill switches for my startup.
>
> Not because I expect to fail — because I need to know when to pivot vs. persist.
>
> If no buyer pays for AI content by Q3: reassess thesis.
> If I can't sign 3 filmmakers by Q2: reassess value prop.
> If a major platform bans AI content: evaluate if market exists.
>
> Most founders don't know when to quit. They either quit too early or too late.
>
> Kill switches are how you know."

### #15: The 6-Month Plan — Validation Over Building

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I mapped out the next 6 months. The core principle: **validate before building**.

The temptation is to build infrastructure — platform, team, fancy events. But that's premature. First, I need to answer two questions:
1. Will buyers pay for AI film content?
2. Do filmmakers want representation?

If the answer to both is yes: scale.
If not: pivot or stop.

**The 6-month arc:**

| Month | Focus | Key Milestone |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Feb | Foundation | Legal ready, website live |
| Mar | Outreach | First filmmaker conversations |
| Apr | First event | 30+ attendees, first signings |
| May | Validation push | 5 filmmakers, deals in negotiation |
| Jun | Deal close | First deal closed (any size) |
| Jul | Assessment | Decide: scale, pivot, or pause |

**The constraints I'm designing around:**
- Part-time founder (7-8 hours/week realistic)
- ~$6-10K budget for 6 months
- No employees (contractors for events only)
- Competition is moving fast

**Why it matters:**
The plan isn't about building a company. It's about answering the question: "Is this a real business?"

Six months from now, I'll know.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I wrote my 6-month plan. It fits on one principle: validate before building.
>
> Month 1-2: Can I sign filmmakers?
> Month 3-4: Will buyers pay?
> Month 5-6: Does the math work?
>
> I'm not building a company yet. I'm testing a hypothesis.
>
> In 6 months, I'll know if this is a real business or an expensive lesson.
>
> Either answer is valuable."

### #16: The Part-Time Founder Reality

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I have a day job. I'm building SuperImmersive 8 on the side. That's a feature, not a bug.

**Why part-time is actually smart at this stage:**
- Forces ruthless prioritization (can't do everything, so do what matters)
- Reduces financial pressure (don't need revenue to survive)
- Prevents over-building before validation
- Maintains optionality (if it fails, still have income)

**The math:**
- ~7-8 hours/week is realistic
- That's 170-200 hours over 6 months
- Enough to validate, not enough to scale

**The tradeoff:**
- Slower than funded competitors
- Can't do everything
- Risk of being outpaced

**The mitigation:**
- Regional focus (Asia-Pacific) where competition is weaker
- Agency model (relationship-based) where speed matters less
- Be willing to go full-time IF validation succeeds

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I'm building SuperImmersive 8 part-time. 7-8 hours a week, nights and weekends.
>
> Some would say that's not serious. I'd say it's strategic.
>
> Part-time forces prioritization. It reduces financial pressure. It prevents building before validating.
>
> If this works, I'll go full-time. If it doesn't, I didn't burn my runway chasing a dream.
>
> Part-time founder isn't a limitation. It's a risk management strategy."

### #17: Distribution First, Filmmakers Second

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
My original plan was wrong.

**Old plan:** Sign filmmakers → Find them distribution
**New plan:** Secure distribution commitments → Use those to attract filmmakers

This is the classic chicken-and-egg problem for marketplaces. Filmmakers won't sign without distribution access. Distribution channels won't commit without content.

**The unlock:** I have a warm lead at Taiwan Mobile (MyVideo). Jamie Lin, the Chairman, said they'd be interested in programming AI shorts.

That's not a cold lead — that's a door that's already open.

**The new sequence:**
1. Send MyVideo a proposal for an AI shorts pilot program
2. Get LOI or commitment in writing
3. Lead filmmaker outreach with: "We're programming AI shorts for Taiwan Mobile's streaming platform"
4. Sign filmmakers who want that access
5. Deliver content to MyVideo
6. Use success to unlock more channels

**Why this changes everything:**
- "We'll try to find you distribution" = weak
- "We have a deal with Taiwan's largest telecom" = strong

**Distribution channels to pursue in parallel:**
1. Streaming (MyVideo, regional OTT)
2. Educational (universities, museums)
3. Festivals (submissions, partnerships)
4. Alternative (tech conferences, galleries, brands)

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I had my marketplace strategy backwards.
>
> Old plan: Sign filmmakers, then find them distribution.
> New plan: Secure distribution, then use it to attract filmmakers.
>
> 'We'll try to find you buyers' is a weak pitch.
> 'We have a deal with Taiwan's largest streaming platform' is a strong one.
>
> Chicken-and-egg problems get solved by finding the egg that's already cracked."

---

### #18: The MyVideo Opportunity

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
Sometimes the most important asset isn't what you build — it's who you know.

I had a meeting with Jamie Lin, Chairman of Taiwan Mobile. He said they'd be interested in programming curated AI shorts on MyVideo.

That single conversation might be the most valuable thing I have.

**Why this matters:**
- Taiwan Mobile = largest telecom in Taiwan
- MyVideo = their streaming platform
- A pilot program = real distribution, real validation, real credibility

**What I need to do:**
1. Write a compelling proposal (pilot concept, timeline, what we deliver)
2. Follow up professionally
3. Get something in writing (LOI, email confirmation, anything)
4. Use it to unlock everything else

**The risk:**
This could go nowhere. Executives express interest all the time and nothing happens. But even a "maybe" from Taiwan Mobile is better than a "yes" from nobody.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I had coffee with the Chairman of Taiwan's largest telecom. He said they might be interested in programming AI shorts.
>
> That one conversation might be worth more than anything I build.
>
> Because 'we're in discussions with Taiwan Mobile' opens every door.
>
> Lesson: Relationships before infrastructure. Warm leads before cold outreach. Credibility before scale."

### #19: APAC + Europe First, US Later (The Beachhead Strategy)

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
My original instinct was to build for "global" distribution. That's a mistake. Going global means going head-to-head with Escape.ai, Curious Refuge/Promise, and whoever else is coming — all of whom are better funded and have Hollywood credibility.

**The pivot:** APAC + Europe first. US later.

**Why this works:**
- **I'm already here** — Taipei-based, with the Jamie Lin/MyVideo warm lead
- **No serious competition** — US players are focused on LA/NYC
- **Growing faster** — APAC streaming is expanding; US is saturated
- **Blue ocean** — "The AI film agency for Asia-Pacific and Europe" is defensible

**The strategy:**
- Sign filmmakers *globally* (most prolific are in US)
- Distribute their work through *APAC + Europe channels*
- Pitch: "We have distribution in markets that US agencies can't offer you"

**When SI8 eventually enters the US:**
- We come with track record and case studies
- We're the incumbent in APAC/Europe
- We're not an unknown trying to break in

**Why it matters:**
This is classic beachhead strategy. Dominate a niche before expanding. Don't fight wars you can't win.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "Everyone told me to focus on LA. That's where AI film is happening.
>
> My strategy: APAC + Europe first. US later.
>
> The US players (Escape.ai, Curious Refuge) are fighting for Hollywood. I'm taking the rest of the world while they're not looking.
>
> When I eventually enter the US, I won't be an unknown. I'll be the company that already owns distribution in Asia and Europe.
>
> Beachhead strategy 101: Win where you can, then expand from strength."

### #20: "Human-Mades" — Naming the Old to Define the New

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I've been struggling with how to position AI films. Are they "real" films? Are they competing with traditional content? Are they lesser?

Wrong framing. The answer: **AI films are a different medium entirely.**

To make this clear, I'm introducing terminology:
- **AI Films** = Content where 90%+ of visuals are AI-generated
- **Human-Mades** = Traditional production (cameras, sets, actors, locations)

**Why "human-mades" works:**
- Creates distinct category (AI films aren't "fake" human-mades — they're something else)
- Avoids direct comparison (we're not competing with Hollywood)
- Positions human-mades as legacy (subtle, not antagonistic)
- Gives buyers a clear choice ("Do you want AI films or human-mades?")

**What to say:**
- "We represent AI filmmakers and their work"
- "Looking for human-mades? That's not what we do"
- "AI films are a new creative medium"

**What NOT to say:**
- "AI-generated content" (sounds clinical)
- "Synthetic video" (sounds artificial)
- "Better than human-made" (antagonistic)

**Why it matters:**
You can't win a positioning battle if you're playing on someone else's terms. By naming the existing paradigm "human-mades," we define AI films as the future — not a cheap imitation of the past.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I've started calling traditional filmmaking 'human-mades.'
>
> Not to be dismissive — to be clear.
>
> AI films aren't fake human-mades. They're a different medium. Like photography vs. painting. Digital vs. analog.
>
> When someone asks 'is AI film as good as real film?' — they're asking the wrong question.
>
> It's not about better or worse. It's about different.
>
> Human-mades have their place. AI films have theirs. We represent the new."

### #21: AI as Strategic Thinking Partner

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I ran my business strategy through three different AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) and asked each to critique my plan. Then I compared their feedback.

The result? They caught blind spots I couldn't see. They disagreed with each other in useful ways. And the synthesis was sharper than any single perspective.

**What I learned:**
- AI agents are excellent "strategic sparring partners"
- Different models have different blind spots and strengths
- The value isn't in any single answer — it's in the triangulation
- You still need human judgment to synthesize and decide

**The process I used:**
1. Wrote a detailed summary of the business and three strategic paths
2. Gave each AI the same context and asked for critique
3. Compared where they agreed (high confidence) vs. disagreed (requires judgment)
4. Used the synthesis to pressure-test my assumptions

**Why it matters:**
Solo founders don't have co-founders to argue with. AI gives you that sparring partner — available 24/7, no ego, brutally honest when prompted.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I don't have a co-founder. So I built a virtual board of advisors.
>
> I ran my startup strategy through Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini. Same context, same questions. Then I compared their answers.
>
> Where they agreed: high confidence signal.
> Where they disagreed: requires my judgment.
>
> The synthesis was sharper than any single perspective.
>
> Solo founders: AI isn't just a productivity tool. It's the thinking partner you don't have.
>
> The trick isn't asking one AI for the answer. It's triangulating across multiple perspectives and synthesizing with your own judgment."

### #22: The Revenue Reality Check — When Your Thesis Hits Math

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I built a detailed 6-month plan for AI film distribution. It was strategically sound. The validation milestones were clear. The kill switches were set.

Then I ran the revenue math.

**AI Shorts Distribution (Year 1):**
- Streaming pilot deals: $3-5K each, 25% commission = $750-1,250 per deal
- Educational licensing: $1-3K each, 25% commission = $250-750 per deal
- Realistic volume: 10-15 deals
- **Total Year 1 commission: ~$10-12K**

That's not a business. That's a hobby.

**The uncomfortable truth:**
To make $100K in commissions (enough to quit my job), I need to broker $400K in deals. At $3K average deal size, that's 130+ deals per year. At 8 hours/week, that's impossible.

**What the math revealed:**
- AI shorts distribution is a loss leader, not a standalone business
- The deal sizes are too small to support a full-time founder
- I was optimizing for validation, not viability

**Why it matters:**
Validation and viability are different questions. You can validate that buyers will pay for AI content — and still not have a real business because the unit economics don't work.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "My business plan was strategically sound. Then I ran the revenue math.
>
> AI shorts distribution: $3-5K deals, 25% commission.
> Year 1 projection: ~$10-12K.
>
> That's not a business. That's a side project.
>
> Here's what I learned: Validation and viability are different questions.
>
> 'Will buyers pay?' — Yes, probably.
> 'Will they pay enough for me to quit my job?' — The math says no.
>

### #23: When Three AIs Disagree — And What That Tells You

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I asked three AI agents whether to prioritize distribution, events, or actor licensing. They gave me different answers.

**Claude:** Do distribution + lightweight events. Defer actor licensing.
**ChatGPT:** Do distribution (70%) + subordinate events (30%). Defer actor licensing.
**Gemini:** Kill events entirely. Distribution only. "Events are buying a farm to get a glass of milk."

Then I pushed back with the revenue math: events generate 2x the revenue of distribution.

**What the disagreement revealed:**
- ChatGPT and Claude were optimizing for validation speed
- Gemini was optimizing for focus (but ignoring revenue reality)
- None of them initially caught the revenue math problem
- When I pushed back, they all adjusted their recommendations

**The meta-lesson:**
AI agents are excellent at reasoning *within* the frame you give them. They're less good at questioning the frame itself. The revenue math challenge came from me, not them.

**Why it matters:**
AI is a thinking partner, not a thinking replacement. The best insights came from the *dialogue* — from pushing back on their recommendations and forcing them to reconsider.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I asked three AIs which path to prioritize for my startup. They all gave different answers.
>
> Claude: Distribution + events.
> ChatGPT: Mostly distribution.
> Gemini: Distribution only. Kill events.
>
> Then I pushed back: 'But events generate 2x the revenue.'
>
> They all paused and reconsidered.
>
> Here's the meta-lesson: AI agents are great at reasoning within your frame. They're less good at questioning the frame.
>
> The breakthrough came from the dialogue — not from any single answer.
>
> Use AI to think WITH, not to think FOR you."

### #24: The Hybrid Model — When No Single Path Works

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
After running the revenue math, I realized neither distribution nor events alone could support a full-time founder. The numbers just don't work.

**Distribution only:** ~$10-12K/year (too small)
**Events only:** ~$20-25K/year (still not enough)
**Combined:** ~$30-35K/year (still short)

So what's the actual path to quitting my job?

**The hybrid model:**

| Revenue Stream | Year 1 Target | Why It Works |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Distribution | $10-15K | Builds credibility and deal flow |
| Events (2-3/year) | $15-20K | Predictable revenue, sponsor relationships |
| Consulting | $15-25K | Monetizes expertise immediately |
| **Total** | **$40-60K** | |

**The insight:** Consulting is the missing piece. Brands and studios will pay $5-15K for "how do we use AI in our content?" advisory work. I'm building expertise they need. This is faster money than distribution or events.

**The reframe:**
- Distribution = credibility builder (not revenue driver)
- Events = community + sponsors (predictable but capped)
- Consulting = near-term revenue engine
- Actor licensing = the big unlock (but later)

**Why it matters:**
Sometimes the business model isn't one thing — it's a portfolio of revenue streams that mature at different rates.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I modeled three paths for my startup. None of them worked alone.
>
> Distribution: $10-12K/year.
> Events: $20-25K/year.
> Neither is a job.
>
> So I built a hybrid:
> - Distribution for credibility
> - Events for community
> - Consulting for near-term revenue
>
> Year 1 target: $40-60K from the mix.
>
> The lesson: Sometimes the business isn't one thing. It's a portfolio that matures at different rates.
>
> Distribution builds the reputation.
> Consulting pays the bills.
> The big unlock comes later.
>
> Don't force a single-product business when a portfolio makes more sense."

### #25: Asking the Right Question — "What Gets Me to Full-Time?"

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I spent weeks optimizing for "validation" — can I close a deal? Can I sign filmmakers? Can I prove the thesis?

Wrong question.

The right question: **What gets me to full-time?**

That question changes everything:
- Validation asks: "Is this real?"
- Viability asks: "Can this pay my rent?"

**The shift:**
- Before: "How do I validate fastest?"
- After: "What's the fastest path to $80-100K/year?"

These are different optimization targets. Validation might lead me to pursue small streaming deals. Viability might push me toward higher-value brand work or consulting.

**Why it matters:**
If you want to eventually do this full-time, you need to design for that outcome from Day 1. Otherwise you build a validated side hustle that can never become a real business.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I spent weeks optimizing for 'validation.'
>
> Can I close a deal? Can I sign filmmakers?
>
> Wrong question.
>
> The right question: What gets me to full-time?
>
> Validation asks: 'Is this real?'
> Viability asks: 'Can this replace my salary?'
>
> They're different optimization targets.
>
> If you want to eventually quit your job, you need to design for that outcome from Day 1.
>
> Otherwise you build a validated side hustle that can never become a real business.
>
> Ask the right question."

### #26: Play to Your Proven Playbook

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
Three AI agents told me to deprioritize or kill events. Their reasoning was sound:
- "Events are time sinks"
- "Minimum wage when you calculate hourly rate"
- "Focus on consulting, not community"

Then I remembered something important: **I've done this before.**

I have years of experience as a B2B enterprise sales consultant. I've hosted B2B conferences that consistently convert to consulting work. Events → Consulting is my proven playbook.

The AI agents were giving me generic founder advice. But I'm not a generic founder. I have a specific skill set and a proven motion.

**The reframe:**
- Generic advice: "Events are inefficient for most founders"
- My reality: "Events are how I close high-ticket deals"

**Why it matters:**
Strategic advice has to account for *who you are*, not just *what the business is*. A playbook that works for you is worth more than an "optimal" strategy you can't execute.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "Three AI agents told me to kill my event strategy.
>
> 'Events are time sinks.'
> 'Minimum wage hourly rate.'
> 'Focus on consulting instead.'
>
> Then I remembered: I've run B2B conferences for years. They consistently convert to consulting clients.
>
> Events aren't a time sink for me. They're my competitive advantage.
>
> Here's the lesson: Generic advice ignores who you are.
>
> A 'suboptimal' strategy you can execute beats an 'optimal' strategy that doesn't fit your skills.
>
> Know your playbook. Play to it."

### #27: When AI Gives Generic Advice — Push Back With Context

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I ran my strategy through three AI agents. They all converged on "consulting is the revenue spine, events are a distraction."

But they didn't know my background. When I pushed back with:
- "I have years of B2B sales experience"
- "Events → Consulting is my proven motion"
- "Cold outreach without a platform is low-conversion for me"

They immediately revised their recommendations.

**What I learned:**
AI agents optimize based on the information you give them. If you give them generic context, you get generic advice. If you give them YOUR context, you get personalized strategy.

**The pattern:**
1. Ask AI for advice → Get generic answer
2. Push back with personal context → Get revised answer
3. The revised answer is usually better

**Why it matters:**
The value of AI isn't in the first answer. It's in the dialogue. The more you push back with "but here's my situation," the sharper the advice becomes.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I asked AI for startup advice. The answer was smart but generic.
>
> Then I pushed back: 'But I have 10 years of B2B sales experience. Events are how I close deals.'
>
> The AI immediately revised its recommendation.
>
> Here's the pattern:
> - First answer: Generic best practice
> - After pushback: Personalized strategy
>
> AI doesn't know your context until you tell it. The value isn't in the first answer — it's in the dialogue.
>
> Don't accept generic advice. Push back with your reality."

### #28: Events as Consulting Funnel — The Reframe That Changed Everything

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I was thinking about events wrong.

**Old framing:** Events are a product (tickets + sponsors = revenue)
**New framing:** Events are a funnel (attendees become consulting clients)

This changes the math completely.

**Old calculation:**
- 4 events/year
- $22.5K profit after costs
- 150 hours invested
- Hourly rate: $150/hour

**New calculation:**
- 2 events/year
- Each event generates 2 consulting clients
- Clients pay $3K/month for 12 months
- Revenue: $144K/year from event-sourced clients
- ROI: Incalculable

**The key shift:**
The event isn't the business. The event is the sales meeting.

**What this means in practice:**
- Audience shifts from B2C (filmmakers) to B2B (agency execs, brand marketers)
- Success metric shifts from tickets sold to meetings booked
- Format shifts from "community gathering" to "executive briefing"
- My role shifts from "host" to "expert they want to hire"

**Why it matters:**
Same activity. Completely different business model. The reframe unlocks a path to $100K+ that the original model couldn't reach.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I was thinking about events wrong.
>
> Old model: Events = product (tickets + sponsors)
> New model: Events = funnel (attendees become clients)
>
> The math changes completely.
>
> If an event costs $3K and generates 2 consulting clients at $36K/year each...
> That's a 24x ROI.
>
> The event isn't the business. The event is the sales meeting.
>
> Same activity. Completely different economics.
>
> Sometimes the breakthrough isn't a new idea. It's seeing an old idea differently."

### #29: The Two-Layer Model — Services Fund the Platform

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I finally cracked the business model puzzle. Neither distribution nor events alone generates enough revenue to quit my job. The answer: a two-layer structure.

**Layer 1 (Private): Production Services**
- B2B AI video production for agencies
- $5-15K per project, $2-5K/month retainers
- Not on the website — acquired through B2B sales
- A time sink, but necessary to pay the bills

**Layer 2 (Public): Distribution + Events**
- The real business — what the brand stands for
- Filmmaker representation, content licensing, B2B events
- This is the scalable, passion-aligned play
- What the website showcases

**Why this works:**
- Production generates cash flow NOW
- Distribution builds the platform that scales LATER
- Production work doubles as filmmaker scouting
- Agency clients become event attendees

**The key reframe:**
Production isn't a distraction from distribution. Production IS the distribution pipeline. When I hire AI creators for agency work, I'm auditioning them for the roster.

**The transition:**
- Year 1: 60% production / 40% distribution
- Year 2: 40% production / 60% distribution
- Year 3+: 20% production / 80% distribution (the goal)

**Why it matters:**
This structure acknowledges a hard truth: passion projects need funding. The sexy part (distribution, events, building the industry) doesn't pay enough at Year 1 scale. The unsexy part (production management) does.

But the unsexy work isn't wasted — it feeds directly into the sexy work. Every production gig is a scouting opportunity. Every agency relationship is a potential event sponsor.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I solved my startup's revenue problem with a two-layer model.
>
> Layer 1: Production services for agencies (pays the bills)
> Layer 2: Distribution + events (builds the platform)
>
> The public brand is about distribution. That's the passion.
> The private work is production. That's the cash flow.
>
> But here's the insight: they're not separate.
>
> Every production gig is a filmmaker audition.
> Every agency client is a future event attendee.
> Layer 1 doesn't distract from Layer 2. It feeds it.
>
> Services fund the platform. The platform builds the future.
>
> Year 1: 60% production.
> Year 3: 80% distribution.
>
> You don't have to choose between paying rent and building your vision.
> You just need a structure that does both."

### #30: Productize or Die — The Service Trap

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
After validating the two-layer model with multiple AI agents, I got a unanimous warning: **Layer 1 (production) will eat Layer 2 (distribution) unless you productize it.**

The temptation is to say "yes" to every custom project because the money is real. But custom work is a trap:
- Every custom project requires founder time
- Custom scope creep is infinite
- You become a freelancer, not a founder

**The fix: Two packages only.**

| Package | Price | What's Included |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| AI Video Pilot Sprint | $8-15K | 30-day fixed scope, 12 videos or 1 hero + cutdowns |
| Agency Retainer | $2.5-7.5K/mo | Monthly video output, tiered by volume |

No custom one-offs. No "can you also..." requests.

**The capacity cap:**
- Max 2 retainers + 1 sprint active at any time
- This protects Layer 2 by design

**The General Contractor Rule:**
- Never touch the tools yourself
- You are: sales + creative director + QC + rights wrapper
- If a project requires you to edit video, decline it

**Why it matters:**
The difference between a founder and a freelancer is whether you're building an asset or trading time for money. Productizing Layer 1 is what lets Layer 2 exist.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I almost fell into the service trap.
>
> Custom production work pays well. It's tempting to say yes to everything.
>
> But here's what I learned: Every 'yes' to a custom project is a 'no' to building the real business.
>
> The fix: Productize ruthlessly.
>
> Two packages. Fixed scope. Capped capacity.
>
> No custom one-offs. No scope creep.
>
> The General Contractor Rule: I never touch the tools. I scope, staff, and QC.
>
> If I'm editing video, I'm not building a company.
>
> Productize or die. There's no middle ground."

### #31: Loyalty Buying — Why Production Unlocks Distribution

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I thought production was just "scouting" — a way to identify talented filmmakers for my distribution roster. That's partially true, but it misses the deeper dynamic.

Production isn't scouting. **Production is loyalty buying.**

Here's how it works:
- If I cold-approach a filmmaker and ask for distribution rights: "What have you done for me?"
- If I pay them $3,000 for a commercial gig first, then ask to represent their short film: "Yes, absolutely."

The commercial project isn't just revenue. It's proof that I can get them paid. It's the beginning of a relationship where I've already delivered value.

**The strategic implication:**
Layer 1 (production) isn't separate from Layer 2 (distribution). Layer 1 *earns* Layer 2.

Every production gig is:
1. Revenue for the founder
2. Income for the filmmaker
3. A relationship deposit
4. An audition for the roster

**The conflict of interest:**
This creates tension. As a distributor, my duty is to get the highest price for filmmakers. As a producer, my incentive is to pay the lowest price.

The fix: **Transparency.**
- "I have a $10K budget. I'm taking $4K for management/sales, you get $6K."
- Don't hide the numbers. Trust compounds.

**Why it matters:**
Most distribution agencies ask filmmakers for rights without having proven value first. That's a cold ask. Production lets you warm it up with cash.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "Production isn't scouting. Production is loyalty buying.
>
> If I ask a filmmaker for distribution rights cold, they ask: 'What have you done for me?'
>
> If I pay them $3,000 for a commercial first, then ask to represent their short film, they say: 'Yes.'
>
> The commercial isn't just revenue. It's proof I can get them paid.
>
> But there's a catch: conflict of interest.
>
> As their distributor, I should get them the highest price.
> As their employer on commercials, I want to pay the lowest price.
>
> The fix: transparency.
>
> 'I have a $10K budget. I'm taking $4K for management, you get $6K.'
>
> Don't hide the numbers. Trust compounds.
>
> Loyalty isn't bought with promises. It's bought with payments."

### #32: The Friday Rule — Protecting What Matters

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
Both AI agents I consulted gave me the same warning: Layer 1 (production) will consume Layer 2 (distribution) unless you protect Layer 2 structurally.

Willpower isn't enough. You need rules.

**The Friday Rule:**
- 20% of my weekly hours are reserved exclusively for Layer 2
- For me, that's Friday mornings
- Layer 2 activities: filmmaker sourcing, buyer development, public brand building
- Layer 1 fires are forbidden during this block

**Why it works:**
- If Layer 2 doesn't have scheduled time, it loses
- Production deadlines feel urgent; distribution development doesn't
- But urgent ≠ important
- The only way to protect important-but-not-urgent work is to calendar it like a client meeting

**The meta-lesson:**
The thing you're building for the future will always lose to the thing demanding attention today — unless you protect it by design.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "The urgent will always beat the important — unless you protect the important by design.
>
> I call it the Friday Rule.
>
> 20% of my week is reserved for building the future.
> Production fires are forbidden during this block.
>
> Without this rule, Layer 1 (what pays today) consumes Layer 2 (what scales tomorrow).
>
> The work that feels most urgent is rarely the work that matters most.
>
> Calendar the important. Protect it like a client meeting.
>
> If it's not scheduled, it's not real."

### #33: Parallel Tracks — Don't Let One Deal Block Everything

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I almost made a classic founder mistake: betting everything on one warm lead (MyVideo) and waiting for it to close before doing anything else.

The MyVideo deal with Jamie Lin (Taiwan Mobile Chairman) is real and warm. But even warm deals can take months. If I wait for MyVideo before pursuing other revenue, I could burn 3-4 months with nothing to show.

**The solution: Parallel Tracks**

```
TRACK 1: MyVideo (Taiwan)           TRACK 2: SEA Agencies
├── Distribution credibility        ├── Production revenue
├── Warm lead, can close quickly    ├── Cold outreach, takes time
└── If it hits, accelerates all     └── Generates cash while waiting
```

**Why this works:**
- MyVideo is a credibility play, not a revenue play
- SEA agencies are the primary revenue target (Layer 1 production)
- If MyVideo closes first → "We're on Taiwan Mobile" makes SEA outreach easier
- If SEA closes first → Revenue funds operations while MyVideo develops
- Both tracks reinforce each other

**The lesson:**
Don't sequence when you can parallelize. Especially don't let a deal you don't control block deals you do control.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I almost made a classic founder mistake: betting everything on one warm lead.
>
> The deal was real. The contact was senior. It could close any week.
>
> But warm deals can take months. What do you do while waiting?
>
> My answer: parallel tracks.
>
> Track 1: The warm deal (credibility play)
> Track 2: Cold outreach (revenue play)
>
> If Track 1 closes first, it accelerates Track 2.
> If Track 2 closes first, it funds operations while Track 1 develops.
>
> Don't sequence when you can parallelize.
> Especially don't let a deal you don't control block deals you do control."

### #34: Legal Expertise as Competitive Moat

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I've been thinking about positioning wrong. I kept saying "AI film distribution" — but that's a commodity. Anyone can say they distribute AI films.

What's actually scarce? **Legal clarity.**

Most agencies and filmmakers are confused about AI rights:
- Can AI content be copyrighted?
- Who owns the output?
- What liability exists from training data?
- What do platforms require?

If I become the person who can answer these questions confidently, that's a real moat. Neither Escape.ai (platform model) nor Promise (production studio) are positioning around rights expertise.

**The repositioning:**
- Old: "We distribute AI films"
- New: "We help AI filmmakers and brands navigate creation, rights, and distribution"

**What this means in practice:**
- Build an internal "AI Video Rights Playbook"
- Create rights checklists for every production project
- Develop brand safety guidelines for agency clients
- Position legal expertise as a key sales differentiator

**Why it matters:**
The agencies I want to sell to are scared of AI. Not of the technology — of the legal uncertainty. If I can say "We've done the legal homework so you don't have to," that's a value prop that pure production shops can't match.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "Everyone's positioning around AI video production. I'm positioning around AI video rights.
>
> Here's why: Most agencies are scared of AI. Not of the technology — of the legal uncertainty.
>
> Can this be copyrighted? Who owns it? What's our liability?
>
> If I can answer those questions confidently, I'm not selling production.
> I'm selling peace of mind.
>
> In a market full of uncertainty, clarity is the moat."

### #35: The 66 Gaps — Strategy is Easy, Execution is Hard

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
After weeks of strategic planning with multiple AI agents, I had a beautiful business plan. Two-layer model. Parallel geographic tracks. Legal expertise positioning. Revenue projections.

Then I asked: "What's actually missing from the execution plan?"

The answer: **66 items.**

Messaging templates. Event playbooks. Production delivery processes. Pricing frameworks. Tools and systems. Risk contingencies. And more.

**The realization:**
Strategy is the easy part. Execution is the hard part.

I had confused "having a plan" with "being ready to execute." I wasn't ready. I had frameworks but no scripts. Vision but no checklists.

**What I did:**
Created a running "Execution Gaps" list with 66 specific items to finalize, prioritized by when they're needed:
- **Critical (Month 1):** Website, contracts
- **High (Month 2):** Outreach messaging, event playbook, production process
- **Medium (Month 3):** Pricing, tools, metrics
- **Lower (Month 4+):** Risk plans, personal brand

**The lesson:**
Don't confuse strategic clarity with execution readiness. A beautiful plan means nothing if you can't write the first outreach message.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "After weeks of strategic planning, I thought I was ready to launch.
>
> Then I asked: 'What's actually missing from the execution plan?'
>
> The answer: 66 items.
>
> Messaging templates. Event playbooks. Production processes. Pricing frameworks.
>
> I had confused 'having a strategy' with 'being ready to execute.'
>
> Strategy is the easy part. The hard part is the checklist nobody wants to write.
>
> Now I have a running list of 66 gaps. I'll check them off one by one.
>
> That's not sexy work. But it's the work that actually matters."

### #36: The "No List" — What You Won't Do Matters More Than What You Will

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
I spent weeks planning what I'd do. Then a peer reviewer asked: "What's your No List?"

I didn't have one.

The "No List" is your safe lane — explicit boundaries on what you won't touch. Not for moral reasons (though some items are), but for operational sanity. Every "yes" you say creates scope. Every undefined boundary becomes a negotiation.

**My No List:**
- No celebrity likeness
- No voice cloning of real people
- No explicit IP imitation
- No political persuasion content
- No deepfakes
- No projects without signed brief
- No projects without creator capacity

**Why this matters:**
The fastest way to drown isn't saying yes to bad work. It's saying yes to undefined work. A clear No List prevents catastrophic time waste, legal exposure, and reputation risk.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I spent weeks planning what I'd do.
>
> Then someone asked: 'What's your No List?'
>
> I didn't have one.

### #37: Scope Creep Will Kill You — Production is Where Founders Drown

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
A seasoned advisor told me: "I'll tell you what breaks first in 90% of services businesses: production scope creep."

Here's the pattern:
- You land one client
- They love the first draft
- "Just one more tweak"
- Then another
- Then a new direction
- You lose 3 weeks
- Everything else dies

**The brutal math:**
If a $10K project takes 15 hours as planned, you're earning $666/hour.
If scope creep turns it into 60 hours, you're earning $166/hour.
And you've killed three weeks of Layer 2 development.

**The fix:**
- Package constraints: 2 rounds of revisions max
- One consolidated revision document (no ping-pong)
- Client must fill production brief before work begins
- Scope changes = new SOW + new invoice

This isn't about being difficult. It's about being sustainable.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "The #1 thing that kills services businesses? Scope creep.
>
> Here's the pattern:
> - Client loves the first draft
> - 'Just one more tweak'
> - Then another
> - Then a new direction

### #38: Pick ONE City — Parallel Markets is a Lie

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
My first draft had me targeting Singapore + Manila + KL + Bangkok + Jakarta.

A peer reviewer said: "You'll get none."

Here's why: Each market requires:
- Different agency landscape
- Different LinkedIn networks
- Different cultural nuances
- Different time zones for calls

With 10-15 hours/week, I can't do five markets at 20% each. I can do ONE market at 100%.

**The decision:**
Month 1-2: Singapore ONLY
Month 3+: Expand only after Singapore playbook is working

**The lesson:**
"Parallel" sounds strategic. It's usually just unfocused.

Pick one. Go deep. Prove it works. Then expand.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "My first draft: Target Singapore, Manila, KL, Bangkok, Jakarta.
>
> The feedback: 'You'll get none.'
>
> Here's why: Each market requires different networks, different nuances, different everything.

### #39: The 5-Hour Rule — Outreach is Non-Negotiable

**Date:** January 2026

**The insight:**
After mapping my 10-15 hours/week, I realized how constrained the time is. The temptation is to spend it on "building" — website, playbooks, systems.

An advisor told me: "If you go below 5 hours/week on outreach, you'll miss your revenue target."

That's half my available time on ONE activity.

**Why this matters:**
- Website doesn't generate revenue
- Playbooks don't generate revenue
- Systems don't generate revenue
- Only conversations generate revenue

Everything else is preparation. Preparation that never converts to outreach is just procrastination in disguise.

**My time allocation:**
- 5 hrs: Outreach + calls (non-negotiable)
- 3 hrs: Delivery system + creator relationships
- 2 hrs: Website + assets (iterate, don't perfect)
- 2 hrs: Event planning
- 1 hr: Rights playbook

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "With 10-15 hrs/week, the temptation is to 'build' — website, playbooks, systems.
>

### #40: Demand-Side First — The Reframe That Changes Year 1

**Date:** February 2026

**The insight:**
I've been pitching SI8 as a filmmaker representation agency — supply-side first. Sign filmmakers, build the roster, then find buyers for their work.

Wrong sequence for Year 1.

The money in Year 1 is on the demand side. Brands and agencies have budget. Filmmakers don't pay SI8 — buyers do. And right now, in early 2026, every brand and agency is scared of the same thing: AI content that gets them sued.

That fear is the door opener.

**The reframe:**
- Old pitch: *"We represent AI filmmakers and get them distribution."*
- New pitch: *"Brands and agencies come to SI8 for AI content that won't get them sued — license from our vetted catalog, or commission through our vetted filmmaker network."*

Same business. Same two-layer model. Completely different Year 1 motion.

**What this changes:**
- Outreach leads with the buyer's pain point, not the filmmaker value prop
- The Rights Playbook (which I just built) is now a marketing asset sent to agencies — not just internal infrastructure
- AI Creator Fest leads with brand/agency content ("AI Films for Brands: What's Legal, What's Not, What's Next") — filmmakers are showcased as vetted talent, not the primary audience
- The "won't get you sued" pitch gets me in the room; the filmmaker representation builds the long-term moat

**What doesn't change:**
- The two-layer model (Layer 1 production, Layer 2 distribution)
- The long-term vision — filmmaker representation and catalog licensing IS the Year 2-3 business
- The Rights Playbook, the Safe Lane, the No List
- Revenue targets, APAC focus, Singapore first

**The sequencing:**
```
Year 1: Demand-side leads → production fees + consulting pay the bills
Year 2: Both sides active → distribution commissions growing
Year 3+: Supply-side leads → catalog licensing + filmmaker rep is the scalable platform
```

**Why it took this long to see:**
I was so focused on the long-term vision (filmmaker representation agency, Kobalt-style) that I was leading with Year 3 positioning in Year 1 outreach. The demand-side pitch isn't a compromise — it's the correct opening move. It funds the supply-side build.

**The AI Creator Fest connection:**
The event structure changes completely with this reframe:
- Agencies come to an industry briefing on AI content rights (they clear their calendar for this)
- Filmmakers are showcased as vetted talent — which is better for them than a community meetup
- SI8 is the expert who organized the room
- Every agency exec is a potential production client or consulting lead
- Same event, different frame, much higher conversion

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I've been pitching my AI film company wrong.
>
> I was leading with filmmaker representation — supply-side, agency model, Kobalt for AI creators.
>
> The right Year 1 pitch is demand-side: 'brands and agencies, here's AI content that won't get you sued.'
>
> Same business. Same long-term vision. Completely different opening move.
>
> The money in Year 1 is on the demand side. Brands have budget. The fear is real.
>
> Lead with the buyer's pain. Build the supply-side moat behind it.
>
> Demand-side first. Supply-side forever."

### #41: What Peer Review Taught Me About Building in Public with AI

**Date:** February 2026

**The setup:**
I put Business Plan v2 in front of ChatGPT and Gemini for peer review. I asked them to poke holes. They did.

**The most important challenge they raised:**

"Rights-cleared" is a warranty claim. If a buyer takes your content and gets sued, "rights-cleared" is language their lawyer will read as a guarantee of non-infringement. You can't back that up.

They're right. I was using the phrase because it sounded clean and confident. But it's actually the kind of language that creates the legal exposure I'm promising to prevent.

**What I changed:**

Every instance of "rights-cleared" → "safe lane vetted" or just "safe lane."

The Safe Lane is a *process*. A documented framework. SI8 runs content through the safe lane — that's what buyers are paying for. Not a guarantee of non-infringement. A rigorous, documented, consistent process that significantly reduces risk.

That reframe actually makes the pitch *stronger*, not weaker. It's honest. It's defensible. And it differentiates from any competitor who makes vague "we handle rights" claims.

**Other things peer review surfaced:**

1. **No catalog yet** — you can't pitch "license from our catalog" with zero catalog. Month 1-2 priority: sign 3-5 filmmakers, run their existing work through safe lane review, build the minimum viable catalog.

2. **Advisory board gap** — before the first case study exists, who vouches for SI8? An advisory board listed on the website answers that question. 3-5 people: a lawyer, a brand exec, an AI filmmaker, a platform person. Light commitment, named publicly, invited to the event.

3. **E&O insurance** — flagged but unresolved. AI-generated content may not be coverable under standard media liability policies yet. This is a future investigation, not a Year 1 blocker.

4. **Two test markets, not one** — Taipei is Mandarin-facing (MyVideo, local filmmakers). Singapore is English-facing (SEA agencies). They don't compete. Running both in parallel with a bilingual website gives two real test markets with genuinely different buyer profiles.

5. **One message** — resist the urge to pitch "safer + faster + better." Pick one. "Won't get you sued" is the bet for Year 1. Test it at volume before pivoting.

**What peer review with AI can't replace:**

Real buyer feedback. These are hypothetical objections from a language model trained on business writing. The only objections that actually matter are the ones that come back on outreach.

Peer review sharpened the plan. The market will validate it.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "I put my business plan in front of ChatGPT and Gemini for peer review.
>
> Their best catch: I was using 'rights-cleared' — a phrase that sounds like a legal guarantee I can't actually make.
>
> Replaced every instance with 'safe lane vetted' — which is what SI8 actually does. A documented process. Not a warranty.
>
> The pitch didn't get weaker. It got more honest.
>
> And more honest is more defensible."

### #44: What SI8 Actually Sells — The Delivery Mechanism vs. The Product

**Date:** February 2026

**The insight (courtesy of a Gemini correction):**

I pushed back on Gemini's claim that "Getty doesn't work as an analogy because Getty owns their images." It turned out to be factually wrong. Getty doesn't own ~95% of their library. Photographers do. Getty owns the vetting pipeline — the exclusive right to license, and the legal paperwork that makes images commercially usable.

When they corrected themselves, they said something that reframes the whole business:

> *"When an ad agency buys a photo from Getty for $500, they aren't paying $500 for the JPEG. They are paying $50 for the JPEG and $450 for the guarantee that the model signed a release and the location isn't trademarked."*

That's SI8.

**What SI8 actually sells:**

The video file is the delivery mechanism.

The rights documentation — Safe Lane sign-off, tool disclosure, commercial use authorization, modification rights — is the product.

A brand doesn't come to SI8 for an AI video. They can find AI videos anywhere. They come to SI8 because they need something they can stand behind if their legal team asks questions. The documentation is what they're paying for.

This is why the Rights Playbook isn't a marketing asset. It's proof that the product exists.

**What this changes about the pitch:**

Before: "We make vetted AI video."
After: "We make the legal paperwork that makes AI video commercially usable. The video is how we deliver it."

The fear-based hook stays the same: "Won't get you sued." But now the answer to "how?" is cleaner: "We've documented everything — tools, process, authorization, compliance. You have something to show your legal team."

**The moat, stated correctly:**

SI8 doesn't need to own the content to have a moat. Getty doesn't own most of its content either. The moat is the vetting pipeline — the judgment, the process, the filmmaker relationships, the Safe Lane standards. That takes time to build. Time is the moat.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "Someone asked me what SI8 actually sells.
>
> Not AI video. Anyone can generate AI video.
>
> We sell the legal paperwork that makes AI video commercially usable.
>
> When a brand licenses a photo from Getty, they're not paying for the JPEG.
> They're paying for the guarantee that the model signed a release.
>
> Same logic. AI video is the delivery mechanism.
>
> The Safe Lane documentation — tool disclosure, rights authorization, compliance record — that's the product.
>
> The video is just how we deliver it."

### #43: Services First, Platform Later — The Right Sequence

**Date:** February 2026

**The insight:**
The long-term play is a platform. The short-term play is a services business. These are not contradictory — the services phase is how you validate the platform thesis before building it.

The Getty parallel is not just a positioning analogy. It's a map of where AI video is going.

Photography became ubiquitous because the means of production was democratized. When everyone had a camera, the commercial vetting layer became essential. Getty built that layer and became a multi-billion dollar company — not by being the best photographers, but by being the most trusted source of documented, commercially licensed photographs.

AI video is following the same arc. The tools (Runway, Sora, Kling) are democratizing production. In 2-5 years, AI video will be as ubiquitous as photography. Brands who want to use it commercially will need a vetted source. The platform that builds the vetting infrastructure first will occupy the same structural position Getty holds.

That's the long-term thesis for SI8.

But you don't build a platform on an unvalidated hypothesis. You build it on proof.

So Year 1-2 is deliberate services work — staying close to early customers, learning what brands actually need, proving that the product placement offer is repeatable, building the filmmaker relationships. Every manual process you run is the future platform feature being tested in the real world before it's automated.

The pattern is well-documented:
- Airbnb manually photographed listings before building self-serve
- Stripe did concierge integrations before the developer API
- Uber had dispatchers before the algorithm

The services phase is not a compromise. It's the R&D for the platform.

When the validation signals are clear — repeat buyers, multiple licenses of the same film, filmmakers wanting in, inbound starting to outpace outbound — that's when you raise the capital and build the self-serve infrastructure.

**The VC pitch, when the time comes:**
"We've manually proven that brands pay for vetted AI video. Here are the deals. Here is the process. We want to build the platform that scales this without adding headcount."

That's a much stronger pitch than a deck with a hypothesis.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "The long-term play for SI8 is a platform.
>
> Filmmakers upload. We vet. Brands license. Product placement on demand.
>
> The Getty model, for AI video.
>
> But we're not building the platform yet. Because the thesis isn't proven yet.
>
> Year 1 is services. Manual vetting. Direct relationships. Every deal is a learning.
>
> Airbnb photographed listings by hand before they built self-serve.
> Stripe did concierge integrations before the API.
>
> You build the platform on proof. Not on hypothesis.
>
> So right now, we're doing the work that proves the thesis.
>
> And we're documenting everything as if we'll hand it to an engineering team in Year 3.
>
> Because we will."

### #42: The Insight That Flipped the Model — AI Product Placement

**Date:** February 2026

**The insight:**
Stock footage can't do this. Live-action can't do this. Only AI can.

A brand sees a film in our catalog. They like it — the tone, the aesthetic, the world. But they want their brand *inside* it. Their product on the table. Their logo on the billboard. Their name in the background of the scene.

With live-action, that's a reshoot. Days of production. Significant cost. With AI-generated content, it's a regeneration. The scene stays intact. The brand element replaces the generic one. One workflow, a fraction of the cost.

No live-action catalog can offer this. No stock library offers it. Nobody in AI film has named it as a product.

That's why Tier 2 (custom product placement) became the primary offer — not catalog licensing, not production, not advisory. The thing that makes someone choose SI8 over grabbing content off YouTube or Instagram is the thing only AI can do.

**The model it creates:**

```
Tier 2 (PRIMARY): Custom AI Product Placement in Vetted Productions
Tier 1 (STANDARD): Catalog Licensing As-Is (platforms, airlines, editorial)
Tier 3 (INBOUND): Advisory + Rights Management for custom productions
Tier 4 (INBOUND): Full Bespoke Commission (discretionary)
```

**The analogy that explains it:**

SI8 is Getty Images for AI video — commercially vetted, documented, and safe for brand use — except SI8 can put your brand *inside* the content, which Getty can never do.

That analogy does more work in one sentence than three paragraphs of positioning copy. Every marketing director understands why you pay for Getty instead of right-clicking Google Images. SI8 is the same logic, applied to AI video, with a product placement layer on top.

**The operational requirement this creates:**

Every filmmaker shopping agreement must include a modification clause before Tier 2 can be offered. This is not optional — you cannot sell product placement without the filmmaker's authorization to modify their work. This clause goes into every agreement from day one.

**Why not just grab something off YouTube?**

YouTube content is not cleared for commercial use. Rights provenance is unknown. Training data is unknown. No documentation exists. If something goes wrong, the brand has nothing to stand behind.

SI8's catalog has documentation on every piece: tool disclosure, Safe Lane sign-off, commercial use authorization. That's what brands are paying for. It's not the content — it's the defensibility.

**LinkedIn-ready excerpt:**
> "Here's the thing about AI-generated film that nobody in the market has said yet:
>
> It's not fixed.
>
> With live-action, once you shoot the scene, the background is the background. Changing it means a reshoot.
>
> With AI, you can regenerate specific elements. The scene stays. The generic coffee cup becomes your coffee cup. The blank billboard becomes your campaign.
>
> No reshoot. One workflow. Your brand inside content that's already been vetted for commercial use.
>
> That's what we're building. A rights-vetted AI film catalog where we can put your brand inside the work.
>
> Nobody else has named this as a product yet. We're naming it."

| Feb 2026 | Rights Playbook = marketing asset (not just internal) | Send to agencies after first contact; proof of claim |
| Feb 2026 | AI Creator Fest = industry briefing, not community event | Agencies fill the room; filmmakers are the featured talent |
| Feb 2026 | Business Plan v2 created | v1 archived; v2 is current direction; version history in VERSION_HISTORY.md |
| Feb 2026 | **"Rights-cleared" replaced with "safe lane"** | "Rights-cleared" implies a legal warranty SI8 can't back up; "safe lane vetted" is accurate and defensible |
| Feb 2026 | **Two risk tiers from day one** | Certified Tier (Adobe Firefly only) + Standard Tier (Runway/Pika/Sora); different buyer risk tolerances, same safe lane process |
| Feb 2026 | **Advisory board as Year 1 credibility asset** | Before real deals exist, named advisors answer "who vouches for you?" — 3-5 targets: lawyer, brand exec, AI filmmaker, platform exec |

| Feb 2026 | **E&O insurance flagged for future investigation** | Unknown if available for AI content at small agency scale; not Year 1 blocker, but resolve before significant production volume |
| Feb 2026 | **Business Plan v3 created** | Rights Agency + AI Product Placement model; v2.1 superseded; VERSION_HISTORY.md updated |
| Feb 2026 | **Tier 2 (product placement) = primary offer** | Only AI can do this; no reshoot required; no competitor has named it; justifies premium price |
| Feb 2026 | **"Getty for AI video" positioning adopted** | Every marketing director understands Getty; explains catalog + rights value instantly; product placement is the layer Getty can never offer |
| Feb 2026 | **Modification clause required in all filmmaker agreements** | Cannot offer Tier 2 without explicit filmmaker authorization to modify their work for brand integration |
| Feb 2026 | **Exclusivity framework defined for product placement** | Category-exclusive default; fully exclusive = premium; non-exclusive = lower price, disclosed |
| Feb 2026 | **"Why not YouTube" argument formalized** | Commercial use requires documentation; YouTube/IG content has no rights provenance, no commercial clearance, no defensibility |
| Feb 2026 | **Four-tier services ladder documented** | Tier 2 (placement) leads; Tier 1 (as-is) for platforms; Tier 3/4 inbound only, not advertised |
| Feb 2026 | **"Bad Boy Indemnifier" framing adopted** | Adobe = safe but boring (Firefly only). SI8 = best creative AI tools (Sora/Kling/Runway) made safe. The gap Adobe structurally cannot fill. |
| Feb 2026 | **SI8's value = judgment layer, not documentation** | C2PA/Content Credentials will commoditize provenance documentation. SI8's moat is subjective legal review — Safe Lane vetting, IP assessment — which software cannot automate. |
| Feb 2026 | **C2PA flagged for monitoring** | Open standard that auto-documents provenance. Rebuttal: proves who made it, not whether it's safe to use. Monitor adoption. |
| Feb 2026 | **Passive Reuse added as platform validation signal** | Same asset earns revenue from two different buyers = platform logic proven. Important signal, not the only one. |
| Feb 2026 | **VC path is upside, not requirement** | Three acceptable long-term outcomes: services agency / self-serve platform / VC-backed. All valid. Year 1 work is the same regardless. |
| Feb 2026 | **Process standardization = Year 1 priority alongside revenue** | Every manual process run as if it will become a platform feature. Document everything as if handing to engineering team in Year 3. |
| Feb 2026 | **Content is delivery mechanism; rights documentation is the product** | Getty logic confirmed: brands pay for legal indemnity, not pixels. SI8 sells the Safe Lane documentation; the video is how it's delivered. |
| Feb 2026 | **SI8's moat = vetting pipeline, not content ownership** | Getty doesn't own ~95% of its library; photographers do. Getty owns the right to license + the trust layer. SI8 owns the same thing for AI video. |
| Feb 2026 | **"Rights Package" not "Rights Certificate"** | Package = substantive documented process. Certificate = legal guarantee SI8 can't make. Same substance, honest framing. |
| Feb 2026 | **Secondary pitch line adopted** | "We reduce time from creative idea to legal approval from 3 weeks to 3 days." — the felt experience; complements "won't get you sued" door opener |
| Feb 2026 | **Internal/external canonical framing locked** | Internal: "The file is the carrier. The chain of defensibility is the product." External: "3 weeks to 3 days." |
| Feb 2026 | **Per-asset documentation SKU defined** | 9 structured fields per catalog entry (tool provenance, model disclosure, Safe Lane sign-off, etc.). Structured data not narrative. Platform schema in spreadsheet form from day one. |
| Feb 2026 | **Underwriter→Curator identity progression** | Year 1: risk underwriter (legal teams are the gatekeeper). Year 3+: underwriter + curator (taste develops alongside compliance track record). |
| Jan 2026 | **Ship website in 7 days** | Not perfect — iterate later |
| Jan 2026 | **Rights Playbook v0.1 = 3 pages** | Iterate slowly; only write what helps sell THIS month |
| Jan 2026 | **2 revision rounds max** | Enforce strictly to prevent scope creep |
| Jan 2026 | **Creator bench before scaling outreach** | Can't sell delivery without delivery capacity |
| Jan 2026 | **Event list-building starts Month 1** | Event success depends on distribution list built early |
| Jan 2026 | **Outsource event logistics** | Venue + F&B = contractor; founder owns speakers + content + conversion |
| **Feb 17, 2026** | **Website launched at superimmersive8.com** | Dark→light theme redesign (warm white + golden amber accents); deployed to Bluehost |
| Feb 17, 2026 | **Catalog grid added below hero** | 6 placeholder cards, filter buttons (All/Short Film/Experimental/Narrative), hover overlays with License + Place Brand CTAs; follows Getty/Shutterstock visual pattern |
| Feb 17, 2026 | **Light theme chosen over dark** | Warm white base (#FFFFFF), cream elevated surfaces (#FAFAF7), golden amber accents (#C8900A/#F5C842); moves away from generic tech-dark aesthetic; warmer/more premium for brand buyers |
| Feb 17, 2026 | **"Safe Lane ✓" + "Placement Available" badges on catalog cards** | Green + amber pill badges; immediately communicates the two-tier value (rights safety + placement opportunity) without any copy |
| Feb 17, 2026 | **Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) version live** | index-zh.html — full content parity; EN/繁體中文 toggle in nav; deployed to Bluehost; ready for Taipei advisor meetings |
| Feb 17, 2026 | **Film titles localized for zh-TW** | 霓虹孤獨, 最後的花園, 過境, 訊號消失, 未來田園, 綻放協議 — localized not transliterated; feels native, not translated |

| Feb 20, 2026 | **Lead gen funnel architecture built** | Gated downloads (Legal Brief + Rights Playbook) → email capture → auto-deliver PDF → follow-up nurture → discovery call; Formspree integration on both pages |
| Feb 20, 2026 | **"Getty for AI video" positioning externalized** | Previously internal framing; now explicit in For Brands section: "Brands pay Getty $450 for legal guarantee, $50 for JPEG. We sell same value layer for AI video." |
| Feb 20, 2026 | **Adobe competitive gap weaponized** | "Adobe = safe but boring (Firefly only). SI8 = best creative tools (Sora/Runway/Kling) made safe." — now in Rights Playbook v0.2 + Legal Risk Brief + website |
| Feb 20, 2026 | **C2PA differentiation clarified** | "C2PA proves the video came from Runway. SI8 proves the video won't get you sued by Disney. C2PA is the receipt; SI8 is the legal audit." — documented in playbook + brief |
| Feb 20, 2026 | **Lead gen stack decision: free vs. paid** | Evaluated Zapier ($20/mo) + Kit Creator ($33/mo) vs. free alternatives; chose Vercel Functions (free) + Kit Newsletter (free) = $0/mo total; services phase doesn't justify $53/mo SaaS costs |
| Feb 20, 2026 | **Vercel serverless function built** | Direct HTML form → Vercel function → Kit API integration; skipped Formspree + Zapier entirely; `/api/formspree-to-kit.js` receives form POST, calls Kit API with tag, returns success; eliminates two middlemen |
| Feb 20, 2026 | **Kit 3-email nurture sequence configured** | Day 0 (immediate): Welcome + PDF links; Day 3: Why vetting matters + Adobe gap; Day 7: Final check-in + discovery call CTA; uses Visual Automation trigger on "Lead-Download" tag |
| Feb 20, 2026 | **Lead gen funnel tested end-to-end successfully** | Form submit → Vercel function → Kit subscriber added with tag → automation triggers → sequence starts → Email #1 delivered within 2 minutes; full flow operational |
| Feb 20, 2026 | **Complete free email automation stack achieved** | Website forms + Vercel Functions + Kit free plan = $0/month for unlimited form submissions + 10K subscribers + 3-email nurture; no Formspree, no Zapier, no paid email tools; validated for Year 1 scale |
| Feb 20, 2026 | **Technical insight: direct API > third-party connectors** | Building Vercel function (2 hours) vs. configuring Zapier/Make (30 min setup, $20/mo recurring) — upfront effort pays off month 2+; own the integration, no vendor lock-in, no monthly SaaS creep |
| Feb 20, 2026 | **Lead gen funnel complete and deployed** | Both gated pages live with working forms; email automation active; PDFs ready for Google Drive upload; discovery call calendar link embedded; ready for traffic |

## Competitor Watch List

| Competitor | What to Watch | Why It Matters |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Escape.ai** | Asia expansion, shift to representation services | Primary threat — same thesis, better funded |
| **Promise/Curious Refuge** | Leveraging 50K community for distribution | Could expand from education to representation |
| **Runway** | Vertical integration (tools → distribution) | Category leader with platform power |
| **Traditional agencies (CAA, WME)** | AI creator divisions | Incumbents waking up |
| **Regional players** | Any AI film activity in Taiwan, Japan, Korea | Local competition emerging |

## Questions I'm Still Wrestling With

- How do I validate filmmaker demand before building too much infrastructure?
- What's the minimum viable event that proves the concept?
- Which buyer category should I prioritize first?
- How do I handle IP/copyright uncertainty in AI-generated content?
- What legal counsel do I need? Entertainment lawyer with AI expertise?
- How do I grow r/aifilmreviews without it feeling like self-promotion?
- How do I differentiate from Escape.ai when talking to filmmakers?
- Should I position against Escape.ai or ignore them?
- What's my honest read on timing — too early or just right?
- If legal landscape gets worse, is there a pivot that preserves the work?
- What's the minimum viable proof that this business can work?
- **Should I pull actor licensing (Path C) forward given the revenue math?**
- **Is consulting the real near-term revenue play?**
- **What deal size makes distribution viable? Features only?**
- **Can I reach $80-100K/year by end of Year 1, or is that Year 2 realistic?**
- **What's the minimum credibility to fill a B2B room with agency execs?**
- **How many B2B events per year to hit consulting revenue targets?**
- **Does MyVideo matter more or less in an events-first model?**
- **What's the optimal B2B event format for consulting conversion?**
