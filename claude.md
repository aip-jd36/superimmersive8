# SuperImmersive 8 (SI8) - Project Context

## Business Overview

**SuperImmersive 8** is an AI film distribution agency based in Taipei, Taiwan.

**Tagline:** *"The trusted operator at the intersection of AI creators, rights, and commercial deployment."*

### The Two-Layer Business Model

| Layer | What | Visibility | Purpose |
|-------|------|------------|---------|
| **Layer 1: Production** | B2B AI video production for agencies | Private (B2B sales) | Pays the bills, scouts filmmakers |
| **Layer 2: Distribution** | Filmmaker representation, licensing, events | Public (website, brand) | Builds the scalable platform |

**Transition Plan:**
- Year 1: 60% production / 40% distribution
- Year 2: 40% production / 60% distribution
- Year 3+: 20% production / 80% distribution (goal)

### v3 Strategy: Rights Agency + AI Product Placement (Current Direction — February 2026)

**SI8 identity:** A Rights Agency and Rights Management firm for AI film and commercial content.

**The four-tier model:**
- **Tier 2 (Primary):** Custom AI Product Placement in vetted productions — brand elements regenerated into existing catalog films. "Won't get you sued." Premium price.
- **Tier 1 (Standard):** Catalog licensing as-is — for platforms, airlines, streaming, editorial. Commercial use documented.
- **Tier 3 (Advisory/inbound):** Referral + rights management for brands building their own AI content.
- **Tier 4 (Commission/inbound):** Full bespoke production through vetted filmmaker network. Discretionary.

**Key positioning:** "Getty for AI video — with a product placement layer Getty can never offer."

**Competitive differentiation:** "Adobe = safe but boring (Firefly only). SI8 = best creative AI tools (Sora/Kling/Runway) made safe. We fill the gap Adobe structurally can't."

**Single Year 1 message:** "Won't get you sued." (door opener)
**Secondary pitch line (discovery/proposal stage):** "We reduce time from creative idea to legal approval from 3 weeks to 3 days." (felt experience)

**Internal framing:** "The file is the carrier. The chain of defensibility is the product."

**SI8's value is the judgment layer:** C2PA/Content Credentials will commoditize provenance documentation. SI8's moat is subjective legal review — Rights Verification, IP assessment, training data risk judgment — which software cannot automate.

**Brand identity:** Year 1 = Underwriter (risk reduction, compliance, defensibility). Year 3+ = Underwriter + Curator (taste + safety compound). Do not lead with curation in Year 1.

**Critical operational prerequisite:** Every filmmaker shopping agreement must include a modification clause before Tier 2 can be offered.

**Long-term outcomes (all acceptable):** High-earning services agency / self-serve platform / VC-backed platform. Year 1-2 work is the same regardless. VC path is upside, not a requirement.

**Business plan versions:**
- `BUSINESS_PLAN_v1.md` — supply-side first (archived, January 2026)
- `BUSINESS_PLAN_v2.md` — demand-side first (superseded by v3)
- `BUSINESS_PLAN_v3.md` — Rights Agency + AI Product Placement (current, February 2026)
- `VERSION_HISTORY.md` — version log

### Revenue Model (Year 1 Target: $80-120K)

| Stream | Target | How |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Production (Layer 1) | $50-70K | Agency retainers + sprints |
| Distribution commissions | $5-10K | 25% of deals brokered |
| Event sponsorships | $10-20K | Tool companies, agencies |
| Consulting | $15-30K | From event leads |

### Geographic Strategy: Parallel Tracks

**Track 1: MyVideo / Taiwan**
- Warm lead with Jamie Lin (Chairman, Taiwan Mobile)
- Goal: Close pilot deal → credibility for everything else

**Track 2: SEA Agencies (Primary Revenue)**
- Target: Singapore, Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Jakarta
- English as business language
- Remote outreach (LinkedIn, email, video)

**Filmmakers: Global (English-speaking)**
- Best creators are globally distributed
- SEA-based filmmakers = priority (can hire for agency work + sign for distribution)

## FIRST 30 DAYS — THE 7 THINGS THAT MATTER

*If you only nail these, the entire plan becomes viable.*

| # | Item | Why It Matters |
|---|------|----------------|
| 1 | **Launch website v1 in 7 days** (not perfect) | Positioning, 2 paths, 1 lead form, 1 calendar link, "Rights Verification" blurb. No more. |
| 2 | **Produce 3 credibility assets** | 60-sec sizzle reel, 10-slide deck OR 1-page PDF, Rights Playbook v0.1 (3 pages). Turns cold outreach into warm conversations. |
| 3 | **Lock delivery system** | Brief template, revision doc format, file organization, creator contract template. Before you sell aggressively. |
| 4 | **Build Singapore target list** | 100 agencies. Name, founder/partner, email, LinkedIn, niche, 1 reason why them. This is the substrate of revenue. |
| 5 | **Start outreach: 10/day, 5 days/week** | 50 touches/week. Book calls in Week 3-4. |
| 6 | **Pre-sell event "industry seats"** | If event is Month 3, start booking B2B attendees in Month 1-2. Make them feel scarce. |
| 7 | **Define your "No List"** | Rights Verification boundaries. Prevents catastrophic time waste and risk. |

---

## THE "NO LIST" — RIGHTS VERIFICATION BOUNDARIES

*What SI8 will NOT do (prevents scope creep and risk):*

- ❌ No celebrity likeness (real people's faces without consent)
- ❌ No voice cloning of real people
- ❌ No explicit IP imitation (copyrighted characters, brands)
- ❌ No political persuasion content
- ❌ No deepfakes or deceptive content
- ❌ No adult/explicit content
- ❌ No projects without signed brief (clients must fill intake form)
- ❌ No projects without creator bench capacity (don't sell what you can't deliver)

---

## WEEKLY TIME ALLOCATION (10-15 hrs/week)

| Activity | Hours/Week | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **Revenue outreach + calls** | 5 hrs | Non-negotiable. Below 5 hrs = miss $5K/month target. |
| **Delivery system + creator bench** | 3 hrs | Templates, QC, creator relationships |
| **Website + credibility assets** | 2 hrs | Iterate, don't perfect |
| **Event planning** | 2 hrs | Only if Month 3 event scheduled |
| **Rights playbook** | 1 hr | Iterate slowly — only what helps sell THIS month |

### 12. Risk & Contingency (What Will Break First)

**🔥 Production scope creep** (most common failure mode)
- Fix: Enforce package constraints + revision limits strictly

**🔥 Too many workstreams / context switching**
- Fix: Stable weekly operating cadence (same activities, same days)

**🔥 Event becomes a time sink**
- Fix: Outsource event operations early (logistics = contractor)

**🔥 Overbuilding rights playbook**
- Fix: Only write what helps sell THIS month

**🔥 MyVideo stalls and blocks everything**
- Fix: Don't let Track 1 stall Track 2 — they run in parallel

**Other contingencies:**
- [ ] If SEA agencies don't respond (<10% response rate) — messaging problem, iterate
- [ ] If can't find quality filmmakers — expand search, lower bar initially
- [ ] If first production project goes badly — document learnings, fix process
- [ ] If competitor enters APAC — differentiate on rights expertise + relationships

### 13. Network & Personal Brand
- [ ] Map existing network for warm intros
- [ ] LinkedIn content: 2-3 posts/week
- [ ] Speaking/podcast opportunities

### 14. Cash Flow & Decision Criteria
- [ ] Expense timing by month
- [ ] Minimum deal size worth pursuing ($5K+ for production)
- [ ] Red flags in clients (when to say no)
- [ ] When to fire a client

### 15. E&O Insurance (Future Investigation)
- [ ] Research whether E&O insurance for AI-generated content is available from standard media liability insurers
- [ ] Get quotes at small agency scale
- [ ] Determine if absence of E&O creates sales friction with large-brand buyers
- [ ] Not a Year 1 blocker — investigate before significant production volume

## KEY DEPENDENCIES (Hidden Killers)

| Dependency | Risk | Mitigation |
|------------|------|------------|
| **MyVideo ≠ deal execution** | Warm lead ≠ closed deal. Need: internal champion, legal review, programming needs, budget owner, timeline alignment | 60-90 days realistic, but don't let Track 1 stall Track 2 |
| **Need creator bench before selling** | Can't sell "delivery engine" without delivery capacity | Build 2-3 creator relationships BEFORE scaling outreach |
| **Event success = distribution list** | No list = weak attendance | List-building mechanism in Month 1, not just Month 2 |
| **Offers require credibility artifacts** | Agencies need: 2-3 samples, 1 showreel, 1-2 case writeups | Even mock/personal projects work — but you need them |

---

## GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS (Refined)

**Month 1-2: Singapore ONLY**
- Trying Singapore + Manila + KL + Bangkok + Jakarta = getting none
- Pick ONE city first, prove the model, then expand

**Month 3+: Expand to other SEA markets**
- Only after Singapore playbook is working

## Notes for Claude

- **Business Plan** (`01_Business/plans/BUSINESS_PLAN.md`) is the source of truth for strategy
- **6-Month Plan** (`01_Business/plans/6_MONTH_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`) is the source of truth for execution
- **EXECUTION GAPS list** (in this file) tracks what needs to be finalized — update as items are completed
- When creating content, maintain professional but forward-thinking tone
- Two-layer model: Production (private) funds Distribution (public)
- Parallel strategy: MyVideo (credibility) + SEA agencies (revenue)
- Legal/rights expertise is a core competency, not just admin
- Prioritize simplicity — this is a lean, solo-founder operation
