/**
 * Typed topic-claims fixture (CRC Living Knowledge Phase 1, 2026-08-16).
 * Same discipline as matrix-fixture.ts: NOT a live parser of
 * GOVERNED-CLAIMS.md -- no markdown-parsing precedent exists anywhere in
 * this repository, so a live parser would be new, unjustified
 * infrastructure. Hand-synced mirror; a small CI consistency check
 * (__tests__/retrieval-engine/topic-claims-fixture-consistency.test.ts)
 * catches claim-ID/Lifecycle/Publication-scope drift between this file
 * and the real markdown.
 *
 * Wave 1 candidates (2026-08-16): four U.S. copyright/human-authorship
 * claims, mirrored verbatim from GOVERNED-CLAIMS.md, all at
 * `lifecycle: 'Candidate'` / `crc_eligible: 'Pending'` -- NONE are
 * Adopted, NONE are CRC-eligible. Primary sources independently
 * re-verified via live web search on 2026-08-16 (USCO Part 2 Report,
 * Thaler v. Perlmutter, Zarya of the Dawn), not reused from existing repo
 * research without re-checking, per the explicit PM governance guardrail
 * ("existing repo research is candidate source material only").
 *
 * Deliberately included at Candidate lifecycle rather than omitted
 * entirely: this is the concrete Phase 1 acceptance-test proof that
 * lookupTopicClaims() correctly excludes non-Adopted/non-eligible claims
 * from ever reaching CRC output, using REAL Wave 1 content rather than a
 * synthetic test fixture -- see
 * __tests__/retrieval-engine/lookup-topic-claims.test.ts and the
 * dedicated Wave-1-specific exclusion test in
 * __tests__/retrieval-engine/wave1-candidate-claims-excluded.test.ts.
