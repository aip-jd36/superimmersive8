# Business Plan — Version History

## v3.1 — February 2026
**File:** `BUSINESS_PLAN_v3.md` (updated in place)
**Status:** Current direction

**What changed from v3.0:**
- "The Bad Boy Indemnifier" competitive differentiation added: SI8 gives brands access to the best creative AI tools (Sora/Kling/Runway) that corporate legal teams are afraid of — the gap Adobe structurally cannot fill
- Competitive differentiation table added: Adobe vs SI8 Standard Tier vs SI8 Certified Tier
- C2PA / Content Credentials flagged as a monitoring item — provenance documentation will be commoditized; SI8's value is the *judgment layer* (subjective legal review), not documentation
- Passive Reuse added as platform validation signal: same asset earns revenue from two different buyers proves platform logic
- Platform Horizon refined: VC path is upside not requirement; three long-term outcome options (services agency / self-serve platform / VC-backed platform), all acceptable
- Process standardization named explicitly as Year 1 priority alongside revenue
- One-sentence summary updated to reflect "Bad Boy Indemnifier" framing

## v3.0 — February 2026
**File:** `BUSINESS_PLAN_v3.md`
**Status:** Superseded by v3.1 (same file, updated in place)

**What changed from v2.1:**
- Primary offering reframed: Custom AI Product Placement in vetted productions is now the hero offer
- Secondary offering: Standard catalog licensing as-is (for platforms, airlines, content libraries)
- Tertiary (inbound only): Advisory + Referral + Commission — not advertised, comes from relationships
- Model named: Rights Agency (catalog) + Rights Management (advisory) firm for AI film
- "Getty for AI video" positioning established — explains catalog value instantly
- "Why not YouTube" competitive argument formalized
- Modification clause requirement added: all filmmaker shopping agreements must authorize SI8 to commission brand-integrated versions of catalog works
- Exclusivity framework defined for product placement deals (category-exclusive default)
- Four-tier services ladder documented: Tier 2 (placement) → Tier 1 (as-is) → Tier 3 (advisory) → Tier 4 (commission)

**Why:** The product placement layer (brand elements regenerated into existing AI productions) is uniquely possible with AI content and has no competitor. It justifies a premium price point, differentiates SI8 from stock libraries, and makes the catalog more compelling than a simple licensing play. Standard catalog licensing (Tier 1) still serves platforms and content buyers. Production/advisory stays available inbound.

## v2.1 — February 2026
**File:** `BUSINESS_PLAN_v2.md` (updated in place)
**Status:** Current direction

**What changed from v2.0:**
- Replaced "rights-cleared" language throughout → "safe lane vetted" / "safe lane AI content" (defensive legal framing)
- Added Risk Tiers section: Certified Tier (Adobe Firefly only) + Standard Tier (Runway/Pika/Sora) — offered from day one
- Added Advisory Board as Year 1 action item — credibility asset before first deals close
- Geographic strategy updated: Taipei + Singapore in parallel (Mandarin + English test markets); bilingual website required
- Catalog building elevated to Month 1-2 priority with minimum 3-5 safe lane vetted works required before licensing path is offered
- Single message discipline confirmed: "won't get you sued" is the Year 1 message; no layering until tested
- Process branding vs. piece certification: brand the Safe Lane process, not individual outputs
- E&O insurance flagged as future investigation (not Year 1 blocker)

**Why:** External peer review (ChatGPT + Gemini) surfaced legal liability in "rights-cleared" language, geographic strategy gaps, and missing credibility assets. See BUILD_IN_PUBLIC_LOG.md insight #41.

## v2.0 — February 2026
**File:** `BUSINESS_PLAN_v2.md`
**Status:** Superseded by v2.1 (same file, updated in place)

**What changed:**
- Primary Year 1 pitch reframed: demand-side first ("rights-cleared AI content for brands/agencies") rather than filmmaker representation agency
- Core value proposition updated: buyer pain point ("won't get you sued") as the opener
- Website and outreach lead with buyer-facing framing, not filmmaker-facing
- AI Creator Fest event structure updated: demand-side content leads (brand/agency audience), filmmaker showcase as the proof of claim
- Supply-side (filmmaker representation, distribution) explicitly positioned as the Year 2-3 moat, not the Year 1 pitch

**What stayed the same:**
- Two-layer business model structure (Layer 1 production, Layer 2 distribution)
- Revenue targets and 60/40 → 20/80 transition plan
- APAC + Europe regional strategy (Singapore first)
- MyVideo parallel track
- Legal infrastructure as core competency
- Rights Playbook
- The No List / Safe Lane
- All financial projections

**Why the change:**
- Demand side has the budget in Year 1 — brands and agencies pay; filmmakers don't
- Legal fear around AI content is at peak in 2025-2026 — "won't get you sued" opens doors
- Rights Playbook (now built) is more powerful as a marketing asset to buyers than as internal infrastructure
- Filmmaker representation still builds the long-term moat — just not the Year 1 pitch
- See BUILD_IN_PUBLIC_LOG.md insight #40 for full strategic reasoning

## v1.0 — January 2026
**File:** `BUSINESS_PLAN_v1.md`
**Status:** Archived (reference)

**Core approach:** Supply-side first — filmmaker representation agency, creator-facing public brand, distribution commissions as primary Layer 2 revenue model. Production (Layer 1) as private/B2B revenue engine.

**Reason archived:** Year 1 revenue path was too slow via distribution commissions alone. Demand-side-first approach generates faster revenue while still building toward the same long-term distribution platform.
