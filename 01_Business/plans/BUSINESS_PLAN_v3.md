# SuperImmersive 8
## Business Plan v3.0 — Rights Agency + AI Product Placement

**Version:** 3.1
**Date:** February 2026
**Supersedes:** BUSINESS_PLAN_v2.md (v2.1, February 2026)
**Change summary:** Primary offering reframed around custom AI product placement in vetted productions. Rights Agency + Rights Management model named explicitly. "Getty for AI video" positioning established. "The Bad Boy Indemnifier" competitive differentiation added. Platform Horizon refined — VC path is upside not requirement. Passive Reuse added as platform validation signal. C2PA flagged for monitoring.

> For operational sections unchanged from v2.1 (risk tiers, advisory board, geographic strategy, bilingual website, E&O insurance, Rights Verified, No List, financial projections, filmmaker acquisition), refer to BUSINESS_PLAN_v2.md.

## What Changed and Why

**v2.1 positioning:**
> "Brands and agencies can license safe lane AI content from our vetted catalog, or commission new work through our vetted filmmaker network."

Two equal paths: license or commission.

**v3 positioning:**
> "We put your brand inside AI films that are cleared for commercial use. No reshoot. No legal exposure. That's the part of AI content nobody else is doing."

One primary offer. A catalog underneath it. A production path behind it for when clients need more.

**Why the shift:**

The catalog licensing path (v2.1 primary) is real and valuable — but it positions SI8 as a content library, competing with stock footage and YouTube. The product placement layer is what no stock library can offer and no competitor has named. AI-generated content can be regenerated post-production to incorporate brand elements: logos in backgrounds, products on tables, brand names on signage. No live-action reshoot. One modification workflow. Completely unique to AI.

That capability — not the catalog itself — is the reason a brand chooses SI8 over grabbing content elsewhere. The catalog proves it's real. The rights package proves it's safe. The product placement is why they pay a premium.

---

## The Model — Four Tiers, One Identity

SI8 is a **Rights Agency and Rights Management firm for AI film and commercial content**. Every tier operates under that identity. SI8 is always the rights expert — the firm that ensures commercial use is documented, defensible, and safe.

```
TIER 2 — PRIMARY OFFER (lead with this)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Custom AI Product Placement in Vetted Productions
Brand finds content in the catalog they like. SI8 coordinates
with the filmmaker to regenerate specific scenes — adding the
brand's logo, product, or name. Full rights package included.
Price: Licensing fee + customization fee (premium)
SI8 role: Rights agent + modification coordinator

TIER 1 — STANDARD OFFER (secondary, different buyer)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Catalog Licensing As-Is
Streaming platforms, content libraries, airline entertainment,
editorial. License existing catalog works with full commercial
use documentation. No customization.
Price: Licensing fee
SI8 role: Rights agent + documentation

TIER 3 — ADVISORY (inbound, don't lead with it)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Referral + Rights Management
Brand wants something custom that doesn't exist in the catalog.
SI8 refers to a vetted filmmaker AND manages rights for both
parties through the Rights Verified process.
Price: Advisory/management fee
SI8 role: Rights manager + filmmaker connector

TIER 4 — COMMISSION (inbound, discretionary)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Bespoke Production
Brand wants entirely new work, no existing solution fits.
SI8 acts as production coordinator using the vetted filmmaker
network. SI8 decides whether to take on each commission.
Price: Production fee (highest)
SI8 role: Production coordinator + rights manager
```

**The tiers form a natural services ladder.** Every brand enters at Tier 1 or 2. As the relationship deepens, Tier 3 and 4 become available. SI8 does not advertise Tier 3 or 4 — they come inbound from existing relationships.

## The Primary Offer in Detail — Custom AI Product Placement

### What It Is

A brand browses the SI8 catalog. They find a piece of content that fits their creative direction. Rather than licensing it as-is, they want their brand inside it — their product on a shelf, their logo on a billboard, their brand name in a background scene. SI8 coordinates with the filmmaker to regenerate specific elements. The result is a piece of content that feels custom-built for the brand, delivered with full rights documentation.

### Why This Is Unique

Live-action content is fixed. Once a scene is shot, the background is the background. Changing it means reshooting — days of production, significant cost.

AI-generated content is not fixed. Specific elements can be regenerated with modified parameters. The scene stays intact; the brand element replaces the generic one. This is a capability that stock footage, live-action, and traditional animation cannot match at comparable cost or speed.

**No competitor currently offers this as a named, packaged product.**

### The Pitch

> *"You like this film? We can put your brand in it. One modification workflow — no reshoot, no new production. And because everything in our catalog has been through our Rights Verified process, you won't have legal exposure on the other end. That's the part nobody else is offering."*

### Exclusivity Framework (Required Before First Sale)

Product placement exclusivity must be defined in every Tier 2 deal:

| Type | Definition | Price Signal |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Category-exclusive** | One brand per product category per film (no competing brands in same film) | Standard Tier 2 price |
| **Fully exclusive** | One brand per film, across all categories, for a defined period | Premium |
| **Non-exclusive** | Multiple brands can place in the same film (different scenes/elements) | Lower price, clearly disclosed |

Default: category-exclusive unless otherwise negotiated. Must be defined in the license agreement for every Tier 2 deal.

### Operational Requirements (Must Exist Before Tier 2 Is Offered)

1. **Modification clause in every filmmaker shopping agreement** — SI8 can commission the filmmaker to produce brand-integrated versions of their catalog work. Revenue split and turnaround expectation defined upfront.
2. **Modification workflow documented** — what the process looks like (brief, filmmaker execution, QC, delivery) with realistic turnaround times.
3. **Pricing structure defined** — base licensing fee + modification fee. Modification fee reflects filmmaker's time and SI8's coordination.
4. **Minimum 3-5 catalog works** with modification-authorized agreements before Tier 2 is offered publicly.

---

## The Standard Offer — Catalog Licensing As-Is

### What It Is

The catalog as a commercial content library. Every work is vetted through the Rights Verified process, documented for commercial use, and available for licensing to content platforms, streaming services, airline entertainment, editorial, and education.

### Why This Exists as a Separate Tier

Not every buyer needs or wants customization. Content platforms (MyVideo, airline libraries, streaming services) need volume and documentation — they are acquiring content to fill programming, not to embed brand placement. Tier 1 serves them directly.

Tier 1 also serves as the entry point for brand buyers who are not ready for customization — they see the catalog, license something as-is, and return later for Tier 2 when the relationship is established.

### The Competitive Argument — Why Not Just Use YouTube?

This is the central question every potential Tier 1 buyer will ask. The answer is clear:

Content on YouTube, Instagram, or any social feed is:
- **Not cleared for commercial use** — uploading to YouTube does not grant brands a commercial license
- **Unknown rights provenance** — training data, tool terms, and ownership are undocumented
- **Unvetted for likeness, voice, and IP risk** — no guarantee the content doesn't infringe personality rights or third-party IP
- **Not defensible** — if challenged, the brand has no documentation to stand behind

SI8's catalog is the opposite on every count. This is the same reason brands pay Getty Images licensing fees instead of right-clicking Google Images. Commercial use requires documentation. SI8 provides it.

---

## The Positioning — "Getty for AI Video, With a Product Placement Layer"

**Getty Images for AI video:** professionally vetted, commercially licensed, documented content that brands can use without legal exposure. This is the catalog.

**The layer Getty can never offer:** custom product placement — brand elements regenerated into existing productions. This is the differentiator.

The Getty analogy does three things in a pitch meeting:
1. It explains the catalog instantly — every marketing director understands why you pay for Getty
2. It explains the rights documentation — commercial use requires clearance, SI8 provides it
3. It sets up the differentiator — "except we can also put your brand inside the content, which Getty can't do"

### The Getty Model Clarified — What SI8 Actually Sells

Getty does not own the copyright to ~95% of its library. Photographers do. What Getty owns is the **exclusive right to license** and the **vetting pipeline** that makes those images commercially safe.

When a brand pays Getty $500 for a photo, they are not paying $500 for a JPEG. They are paying:
- A small amount for the image file
- The majority for the **guarantee that the legal paperwork was done** — model releases signed, location rights cleared, ownership documented

SI8 operates on identical logic:

| What the buyer thinks they're buying | What they're actually buying |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| An AI video file | Commercial use documentation + Rights Verified sign-off |
| A branded AI video | Same + modification authorization + placement rights |
| A filmmaker referral | SI8's rights management process + legal judgment |

**The content is the delivery mechanism. The rights documentation is the product.**

This means the Rights Playbook is not a sales asset or a credibility signal — it is proof that the product exists. The SI8 vetting process is what brands are paying for. The video file is how the value is delivered.

**The canonical framing — internal vs. external:**

- *Internal truth:* "The file is the carrier. The chain of defensibility is the product."
- *External pitch:* "We reduce the time between creative idea and legal approval from 3 weeks to 3 days."

Brands don't want to hear "we sell documentation." They want confidence, speed, and reduced friction. What they *feel* is: AI content that used to require weeks of legal back-and-forth now takes days because the paperwork is already done. That is the emotional product. The documentation is how it's delivered.

### The Chain of Title — Product SKU (Per Asset)

Every asset in the SI8 catalog has a structured rights record — not a narrative PDF, but structured data fields that are consistent across every work. This is the documentation that ships with every deal, and the schema that eventually becomes the platform's database.

**Per-asset documentation fields (required for catalog entry):**

| Field | What It Records |
|-------|----------------|
| **Tool provenance log** | Which AI tools were used, which plan/tier, at what date |
| **Model disclosure** | Specific model version (e.g., Runway Gen-3, Sora v2) at time of generation |
| **Rights Verified sign-off** | Reviewer confirmation against No List — no likeness, no voice cloning, no IP imitation |
| **Commercial use authorization** | Filmmaker confirmation of commercial rights; plan documentation attached |
| **Modification rights status** | Whether filmmaker has authorized brand-integrated versions (gates Tier 2) |
| **Category conflict log** | Existing exclusive placements by product category and territory |
| **Territory log** | Licensed territories per deal; exclusivity scope |
| **Regeneration rights status** | Whether original project files and generation parameters are archived and accessible |
| **Version history** | Every licensed or modified version of the work, with buyer and date |

This is **not** called a "Rights Certificate" — because "certificate" implies SI8 is certifying non-infringement, which is a legal guarantee SI8 cannot make. The Chain of Title documents the process rigorously. It gives buyers something to stand behind. It does not eliminate risk — it documents the steps taken to reduce it, which is what a legal team actually needs.

**Why structured data matters:** Narrative documentation cannot be searched, scaled, or automated. Structured fields can. Running the agency on this schema from day one means the platform already exists in spreadsheet form before a single line of software is written.

**SI8's moat is owning the vetting pipeline** — the judgment, the process, the filmmaker relationships, the Rights Verified standards — not owning the content. The same moat Getty built, applied to the AI video era.

### Brand Identity Progression — Underwriter First, Curator Later

**Year 1-2 (Underwriter):** SI8 leads with risk reduction. The fear hook opens doors. Legal teams are the buyer-side gatekeeper. The primary brand identity is: *the firm that makes AI content commercially safe.* Taste and curation are secondary to defensibility.

**Year 3+ (Curator + Underwriter):** As the catalog grows and SI8 has a track record of what good AI film looks like, the curation identity develops alongside the compliance identity. SI8 develops a point of view about quality, not just safety. The brand evolves from "the firm that makes it safe" to "the firm with the best safe AI content."

Both identities are compatible — they compound over time. Year 1 is not the moment to lead with taste. Year 1 is the moment to be the underwriter the market needs.

## Competitive Differentiation — "The Gap Adobe Can't Fill"

Adobe is the default answer for brands who need commercially safe AI content. Adobe Firefly is trained on licensed data, offers commercial indemnification, and is embedded in tools every creative team already uses.

Adobe is also structurally limited. Their indemnification only applies to Firefly. They will never cover Sora, Kling, or Runway outputs — because those tools weren't trained on Adobe's licensed library. Adobe is safe. Adobe is also creatively capped.

**SI8's differentiation:**

| | Adobe (Firefly) | SI8 Standard Tier | SI8 Certified Tier |
|--|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Creative tools** | Firefly only | Sora, Kling, Runway | Adobe Firefly |
| **Creative ceiling** | Limited — licensed library only | Full AI creative capability | Same as Adobe |
| **Commercial vetting** | Built-in indemnification | Rights Verified process + documentation | Rights Verified process + documentation |
| **Product placement** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Who it's for** | Risk-averse brands, conservative legal teams | Agencies wanting creative power with compliance | Fortune 500, financial services, maximum defensibility |

The insight: corporate legal teams are afraid of Sora and Kling — not because they can't produce great work, but because nobody has built the compliance wrapper around them. SI8 Standard Tier is that wrapper. SI8 gives brands access to the best creative AI tools their legal teams are currently blocking.

**In a pitch:** *"Adobe gives you safe. We give you capable — and we make it safe."*

### The Value of "Subjective Legal Review"

Emerging technical standards (like C2PA / Content Credentials) will increasingly automate provenance documentation — cryptographically binding metadata about which tools were used and how. This is useful but not sufficient.

Provenance documentation tells you *who made it and how*. It does not tell you:
- Whether the content infringes third-party IP
- Whether there is an unintended real-person likeness
- Whether the tool's training data creates downstream liability for this specific output
- Whether the content meets the brand's own risk threshold

That judgment layer is what SI8 provides. It cannot be automated by a metadata standard. It is the core of SI8's vetting value, and it becomes *more* important as provenance documentation becomes commoditized — because brands will still need someone to tell them what the documentation means.

**Monitor:** C2PA adoption by Adobe, Microsoft, and platform partners. If provenance documentation becomes a commodity feature, SI8's positioning must clearly emphasize the judgment layer, not the documentation.

## Year 1 Go-to-Market (v3 Update)

### Primary Motion: Tier 2 Product Placement to Brands and Agencies

**The opening pitch:**
> *"[Agency name] — brands are using AI-generated video in campaigns. Most of it is pulled from social feeds with no commercial rights documentation. We've built something different: a catalog of vetted AI productions where we can place your client's brand directly inside the content — logo, product, signage — no reshoot. Full rights package included. Worth 20 minutes?"*

**The follow-up asset:** Rights Playbook v0.1 — proof that SI8 has done the legal homework.

**The qualifying question:** "Has your legal team flagged AI-generated content as a risk?" If yes — SI8 is the solution conversation.

**The secondary pitch line (discovery call / proposal stage):**
> *"We reduce the time between creative idea and legal approval from 3 weeks to 3 days."*

This is the *felt* version of what SI8 delivers. Brands don't want paperwork — they want confidence and speed. The documentation is how SI8 delivers it; the speed to approval is what the buyer experiences.

### Secondary Motion: Tier 1 Catalog Licensing to Platforms

MyVideo, streaming services, airline content libraries, editorial. Pitch is documentation-first: "Every work in our catalog is commercially licensed, Rights Verified vetted, and disclosure-compliant for your platform."

### Tertiary Motion: Filmmaker Acquisition (Catalog Building)

Same as v2.1 — 30 filmmakers, global, English-speaking, APAC-based prioritized. The v3 addition: **every shopping agreement must include the modification clause before any Tier 2 deals are offered**. Modification rights are as important as licensing rights.

---

## What This Model Requires to Work

In order of dependency:

1. **Catalog exists** (3-5 works minimum, modification-authorized) — gates everything
2. **Modification clause in filmmaker agreements** — gates Tier 2
3. **Exclusivity framework defined** — gates first Tier 2 deal
4. **Modification workflow documented** — gates Tier 2 scalability
5. **Advisory board confirmed** — gates website credibility
6. **Bilingual website (EN + ZH-TW)** — gates Taipei outreach
7. **Rights Playbook sent as follow-up asset** — gates warm conversion

### Year 1 Priority: Process Standardization, Not Revenue Maximization

Revenue matters in Year 1 — the business must pay for the founder's time. But the deeper Year 1 job is building repeatable, documentable processes that can eventually become platform infrastructure.

Every manual step should be run as if it will be handed to a software team in Year 3:

| Manual Process (Year 1) | Future Platform Feature |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Filmmaker intake by email + call | Self-serve upload and onboarding form |
| Rights Verified vetting by manual review | Checklist-driven QA with human oversight |
| Rights documentation from templates | Auto-generated from structured intake data |
| Catalog browsing via curated PDF | Searchable, filterable catalog interface |
| Product placement via email coordination | Structured brief + workflow tool |
| Exclusivity tracking on spreadsheet | Database with conflict detection |

This doesn't mean building software in Year 1. It means running the agency in a structured, consistent, documented way — so that when the time comes, the platform already exists on paper.

---

## The Single Year 1 Message

**"Won't get you sued."**

This is the one message. Tier 2 (product placement) makes it more compelling — not just "we vet the content" but "we vet the content AND we can put your brand in it AND it won't get you sued." The message doesn't change. The offering makes it more concrete.

---

## What's Unchanged from v2.1

- Rights Verified process and No List
- Two risk tiers (Certified: Adobe Firefly / Standard: Runway, Pika, Sora)
- Language: "safe lane vetted" not "rights-cleared"
- Advisory board as Year 1 credibility asset
- Both Taipei + Singapore in parallel (Mandarin + English markets)
- Bilingual website required
- E&O insurance: future investigation
- Friday Rule for production trap prevention
- AI Creator Fest as industry briefing (not community event)
- Financial projections and revenue targets
- Filmmaker acquisition criteria (Tier 1/2/3)
- General Contractor Rule
- Capacity cap (max 2 retainers + 1 sprint)

---

## The Platform Horizon

### The Long-Term Thesis

Photographs became ubiquitous because the means of production was democratized — from Kodak to SLR to iPhone. When ubiquity arrived, the commercial vetting layer became essential. Getty Images built that layer and became a multi-billion dollar business — not because they had better photos, but because they had documented, commercially licensed photos that brands could stand behind.

AI video is following the same arc. Generation tools (Runway, Sora, Kling, Pika) are rapidly democratizing production. Within 2-5 years, AI video will be as ubiquitous as photography is today. Brands who want to use it commercially will need a source that is vetted, documented, and defensible. The platform that builds that vetting infrastructure first — before the wave fully arrives — will occupy the same structural position Getty holds in photography.

SI8 is building that infrastructure. The catalog, the Rights Verified process, the filmmaker agreements, the rights documentation — these are not just operational tools for a boutique agency. They are the foundation of a platform.

### Why Start as a Services Business

The services/agency model in Year 1-2 is not a compromise — it is deliberate. Staying close to early customers generates the knowledge the platform cannot be built without:

- What types of AI film do brands actually want their products placed in?
- What does quality mean to a brand's legal and marketing teams?
- What price points work for catalog licenses vs. product placement?
- What do filmmakers care about in modification agreements?
- Where does the vetting process create friction?

Platform businesses built on unvalidated assumptions fail. Platform businesses built on manually-proven foundations scale. Year 1-2 is the validation and learning phase. The platform gets built once the thesis is proven in market.

### What Validation Looks Like

Before shifting to platform investment (or deciding the services model is the right long-term form), SI8 needs to demonstrate:

| Signal | What It Proves |
|--------|---------------|
| 5+ brands have paid for catalog licenses | Demand exists for vetted AI video |
| 3+ repeat buyers | Not a one-time curiosity — strongest signal |
| 1+ film licensed multiple times | Catalog model works |
| 3+ successful product placements | Tier 2 workflow is repeatable |
| **Passive Reuse: 1 film earns revenue from 2+ different buyers** | The same asset has compounding value — platform logic proven |
| 10+ filmmakers actively seeking catalog spots | Supply side is motivated |
| Inbound inquiries beginning to outpace outbound | Brand is working |

When most of those signals are present, the VC pitch becomes: *"We've manually proven that brands pay for vetted AI video and for product placement inside it. Here are the deals. Here is the process. We want to build the self-serve infrastructure to run this at 10x without adding headcount."*

### The Platform Build (Year 3+)

When manual processes are validated and repeatable, they become platform features:

| Manual (Year 1-2) | Platform (Year 3+) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Filmmaker intake by email + call | Self-serve upload and onboarding |
| Rights Verified vetting by manual review | Checklist-driven QA with human oversight |
| Rights documentation from templates | Auto-generated from structured intake data |
| Catalog browsing via curated PDF or link | Searchable, filterable catalog interface |
| Product placement by email coordination | Structured brief + workflow tool |
| Exclusivity tracking on spreadsheet | Database with conflict detection |

**Key discipline for Year 1-2:** Run every manual process in a way that could be systematized. Document standards. Standardize forms. Structure the data. The goal is not to build the platform early — it is to run the agency in a way that *becomes* the platform when the time comes.

### Long-Term Outcomes (Not Requirements — Options)

The platform path and the VC path are upside, not prerequisites. SI8 is worth building regardless of which outcome materializes. A high-earning, technology-powered rights agency in AI video is a valid and valuable outcome on its own terms.

The platform option (and the capital that might fund it) becomes available once the thesis is validated. Three possible long-term outcomes, all acceptable:

**Option A — High-earning services agency:** SI8 grows as a specialized rights agency for AI video. Revenue compounds through catalog growth and deepening brand relationships. No platform build. No external capital. Profitable and sustainable.

**Option B — Self-serve platform:** Once validation signals are clear, SI8 builds the filmmaker upload and brand licensing infrastructure. Scale without proportional headcount growth. Possibly self-funded from services revenue.

**Option C — VC-backed platform:** If Option B requires capital to build at speed, the validated thesis supports a raise. The pitch: *"We've manually proven that brands pay for vetted AI video. Here is the evidence. We want to build the infrastructure that scales this."* This is the most ambitious path and requires the most proof before pursuing.

The Year 1-2 work is the same regardless of which option materializes. Build the catalog. Standardize the processes. Validate the thesis. The outcome becomes a decision to make later — from a position of evidence, not theory.

---

## One-Sentence Summary

**v3:** *"SI8 is a rights agency for AI film — we give brands access to the best creative AI tools their legal teams are afraid of, we vet everything through our Rights Verified process, and we can put their brand inside the content itself — so they get creative power and commercial safety in one package."*
