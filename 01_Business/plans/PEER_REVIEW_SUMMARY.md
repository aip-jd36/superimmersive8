# SuperImmersive 8 — Peer Review Summary

*Prepared: January 2026*
*Purpose: Strategic peer review on 6-month validation path*

---

## Company Overview

**SuperImmersive 8 (SI8)** is an AI film distribution agency based in Taipei, Taiwan. The founder is building this part-time (~7-8 hours/week) while working a day job.

**Core Thesis:** AI-generated film is at an inflection point. Creators are producing high-quality work using tools like Runway, Sora, Kling, and Veo — but lack pathways to monetization and distribution. SI8 provides the "picks and shovels" infrastructure.

**Business Structure:**
```
SuperImmersive 8
├── CORE: Distribution & Licensing Agency
│   └── Represent AI filmmakers, license their work to buyers
├── PIPELINE: AI Creators Fest
│   └── Events that source filmmakers and build brand
├── DEMAND CREATION: r/aifilmreviews
│   └── Subreddit building audience for AI film
└── FUTURE: Actor Likeness Micro-Licensing
    └── Platform for actors to license likeness to AI creators
```

**Business Model:**
- 25% commission on deals brokered for represented filmmakers
- Event revenue (tickets + sponsorships)
- Consulting (brands/studios wanting AI content strategy)

---

## Market Positioning

### Regional Strategy: APAC + Europe First, US Later

The founder has decided to avoid head-on competition with well-funded US players (Escape.ai founded by Matrix VFX legend John Gaeta; Curious Refuge with 50K community, acquired by a16z-backed Promise). Instead:

- Sign filmmakers *globally* (most prolific are US-based)
- Distribute through *APAC + Europe channels* first
- Enter US market in Phase 2 (2027+) with track record

### Brand Positioning: "AI Films" vs. "Human-Mades"

SI8 positions AI films as a distinct medium — not a cheaper alternative to traditional ("human-made") production. This creates category separation rather than direct comparison with Hollywood.

---

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Threat Level | Their Model |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Escape.ai** | High | Platform where creators self-monetize (vs. SI8's agency model) |
| **Curious Refuge/Promise** | Medium-High | 50K community, education-first, now has studio backing |
| **Runway AIFF** | Medium | Prestigious festival, tool company vertical integration |
| **WAiFF** | Medium | Multi-city festival (Kyoto, Cannes, Seoul) |

**SI8's Differentiation:**
1. Agency model (personal representation) vs. platform model
2. APAC + Europe focus (no serious regional competitor)
3. Legal infrastructure as core product (contracts, licensing clarity)
4. Year-round community vs. annual festival competition

---

## Key Asset: Warm Lead

The founder has a warm lead with **Jamie Lin, Chairman of Taiwan Mobile**. Jamie expressed interest in programming curated AI shorts on **MyVideo** (Taiwan Mobile's streaming platform). This is potentially the most valuable asset — a warm introduction to a major regional streaming platform.

---

## Constraints

- **Time:** Part-time founder, ~7-8 hours/week realistic (170-200 hours over 6 months)
- **Budget:** $6-10K for 6 months (legal, events, tools)
- **Solo execution:** No employees, contractors only for events
- **Competition moving fast:** 2026 is a critical year for the AI film space

---

## Validation Philosophy

The founder has set explicit kill switches:
- If no buyer pays for AI content by Q3 2026 → reassess entire thesis
- If can't sign 3 filmmakers who want representation by Q2 2026 → reassess value prop
- If major platform bans AI content → evaluate if market exists

The 6-month plan is designed to validate the thesis, not scale prematurely.

---

## The Three Paths Under Consideration

The founder has identified three potential validation paths for the first 6 months. Given time and budget constraints, they can realistically execute **one or at most two** of these.

---

### PATH A: Distribution Block → MyVideo → Other Channels

**What it is:**
Curate 5-8 AI shorts from signed filmmakers into a 30-minute programming block. Sell it to MyVideo first (leveraging the Jamie Lin warm lead), then use that deal as proof to approach other APAC and European channels.

**Key activities:**
- Sign 3-5 AI filmmakers to representation agreements
- Curate their work into a cohesive programming block
- Pitch and close a pilot deal with MyVideo
- Use the deal to approach other streaming platforms, FAST channels, educational institutions

**What it validates:**
- Will buyers (streaming platforms) pay for AI content?
- Do filmmakers want/need representation?
- Can SI8 broker real deals?

**Pros:**
- Directly validates core business thesis
- Leverages the warm lead (biggest existing asset)
- Creates leverage for all future conversations ("We're on Taiwan Mobile")
- Relatively lower complexity — SI8 is middleman, not creator
- Repeatable if successful

**Cons:**
- Dependent on Jamie Lin following through (executives often don't)
- Need to sign filmmakers first (chicken-egg)
- Pilot deal revenue likely small ($2-5K)
- Doesn't differentiate from competitors doing similar things

**Biggest execution risk:** The MyVideo deal doesn't close. Jamie's interest doesn't convert to commitment, or the deal drags beyond the 6-month window.

**Estimated time:** ~40 hours over 6 months

---

### PATH B: Community Events → Half-Day Conference

**What it is:**
Host 1-2 small community mixers (30-50 people each) featuring AI film screenings and networking. Scale to a half-day conference (~100 people) by Month 4-5.

**Key activities:**
- Plan and execute 2-3 events over 6 months
- Build email list and community channels
- Attract sponsors (AI tool companies)
- Use events to discover and recruit filmmakers
- Create content for social proof and marketing

**What it validates:**
- Is there a community interested in AI film in Taiwan/APAC?
- Can events generate filmmaker pipeline?
- Will sponsors pay to access this audience?

**Pros:**
- Builds brand and community positioning
- Creates pipeline for filmmaker recruitment (feeds Path A)
- Lower external dependency — founder controls execution
- Generates content for marketing (photos, testimonials)
- Sponsor revenue potential ($5-10K)

**Cons:**
- Doesn't directly validate distribution/buyer demand
- Time-intensive (15-25 hours per event)
- Revenue is modest
- Crowded space (many AI film festivals globally)
- Still need content to screen (need filmmakers)

**Biggest execution risk:** Low attendance despite effort. 50+ hours invested, 20 people show up each time. No pipeline, no sponsors, no momentum.

**Estimated time:** ~60 hours over 6 months

---

### PATH C: Actor Likeness Licensing + Brand Commercial

**What it is:**
Find a brand that wants an AI-generated commercial featuring a recognizable actor. Sign one actor to license their likeness. Connect them with an AI creator to produce the commercial using the actor's licensed image. SI8 brokers and facilitates the entire deal.

**Key activities:**
- Identify and approach brands experimenting with AI content
- Find an actor willing to license their likeness for AI use
- Connect brand + actor + AI creator
- Navigate legal/contractual complexity
- Deliver completed commercial

**What it validates:**
- Is there demand for licensed-actor AI content?
- Will actors license their likeness for AI productions?
- Can SI8 facilitate complex multi-party deals?
- Is the "future expansion" business viable?

**Pros:**
- Unique differentiation — nobody else doing this yet
- Higher deal value potential ($10-50K+ for brand commercial)
- Tests the actor licensing thesis early
- Strong PR/marketing story ("First AI commercial with licensed actor")
- Attracts filmmakers by showing paid work opportunities

**Cons:**
- Highest complexity — three-way coordination (brand + actor + creator)
- No warm leads — cold outreach on all fronts
- Legally untested territory
- Longer sales cycle — brand deals take months
- Most ways to fail

**Biggest execution risk:** Can't assemble the three-legged stool. Approach 20 brands, none bite. Or find a brand but no actor, or vice versa. The deal never comes together.

**Estimated time:** ~50 hours over 6 months

---

## Comparison Matrix

| Factor | A: Distribution | B: Events | C: Actor Licensing |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Validates core thesis** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Indirect | ✅ Yes (future thesis) |
| **Warm lead available** | ✅ Jamie Lin | ❌ Cold start | ❌ Cold start |
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Time investment** | ~40 hrs | ~60 hrs | ~50 hrs |
| **Revenue potential** | $2-10K | $5-10K | $10-50K |
| **Differentiation** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Dependency on others** | Medium (filmmakers) | Low | High (brand + actor + creator) |
| **Failure visibility** | Low | Medium | High |
| **If it works...** | Proves buyers pay | Proves community exists | Proves novel model |

---

## Current Thinking

The founder is leaning toward **A + B together**, with C deferred to Phase 2:

**Rationale:**
- A is the critical path — it validates the core thesis using the best existing asset (Jamie Lin warm lead)
- B feeds A — events provide access to filmmakers whose content is needed for A
- C has too many cold-start dependencies without a warm lead for brands or actors
- C's differentiation only matters if the core business (A) is validated first

**Combined time:** A (~40 hrs) + B (~60 hrs) = 100 hours over 6 months (~4 hrs/week)

**How A + B reinforce each other:**
- Events surface filmmakers → filmmakers provide content → content goes to MyVideo
- MyVideo rep invited to events → sees community and content quality → more likely to commit
- Event attendees become email list → leverage for future distribution announcements

---

## Open Questions for Peer Review

1. **Is A + B the right combination?** Or should one of these be swapped for C?

2. **Is the regional strategy (APAC + Europe first) sound?** Or is avoiding the US market leaving too much on the table?

3. **Is the actor licensing play (C) too early — or is early differentiation critical before competitors move?**

4. **Given the warm lead with Jamie Lin, should Path A be the sole focus with maximum resources?**

5. **What are we not seeing? What risks or opportunities are missing from this analysis?**

## Prompt for Peer Review Agent

```
You are a strategic advisor for early-stage startups, with expertise in marketplace businesses, content/media, and go-to-market strategy.

I'm building SuperImmersive 8, an AI film distribution agency based in Taipei. I'm a part-time founder with ~7-8 hours/week and $6-10K budget for the next 6 months.

I've identified three potential validation paths. Given my constraints, I can realistically execute ONE or at most TWO of these paths in the next 6 months.

**The three paths:**

**PATH A: Distribution Block → MyVideo → Other Channels**
Curate AI shorts into a 30-min block, sell to MyVideo (I have a warm lead with the Chairman of Taiwan Mobile), then use that deal to approach other channels. Validates: will buyers pay for AI content?

**PATH B: Community Events → Half-Day Conference**
Host 2-3 events (mixers → conference) to build community, recruit filmmakers, attract sponsors. Validates: is there a community? Can events create pipeline?

**PATH C: Actor Likeness Licensing + Brand Commercial**
Find a brand wanting an AI commercial with a "known actor." Sign an actor for likeness licensing, connect with AI creator for production. Validates: is there demand for licensed-actor AI content? (This is a future expansion idea being pulled forward.)

**Context:**
- I have a WARM lead for Path A (Jamie Lin, Taiwan Mobile Chairman, expressed interest in AI shorts)
- I have NO warm leads for Path C (would be cold outreach to brands and actors)
- Path B is fully within my control but doesn't directly validate buyer demand
- My main competitors (Escape.ai, Curious Refuge) are US-focused; I'm targeting APAC + Europe first
- I've set kill switches: if no buyer pays by Q3 2026, I reassess the entire thesis

**My current thinking:** A + B together, defer C to Phase 2. A validates the core thesis using my best asset; B creates the filmmaker pipeline that feeds A.

**Please provide:**
1. Your assessment of whether A + B is the right combination, or if I should reconsider
2. The biggest blind spot or risk in my current thinking
3. Any alternative framing or path I haven't considered
4. If you disagree with my recommendation, which path(s) would you prioritize and why?

Be direct and critical. I want honest feedback, not validation.

# PEER REVIEW ROUND 2

*Date: January 2026*

---

## Round 1 Summary: What the Agents Said

### ChatGPT Round 1 Recommendation:
- A + B is correct, but B must be subordinate to A (70/30 split)
- A = credibility acquisition, not revenue
- Events exist only to increase A's odds
- Defer Path C, but do "C-adjacent discovery"
- Key insight: "You are not yet ruthless enough about time-boxing executive ambiguity"

### Gemini Round 1 Recommendation:
- Kill Path B (Events) entirely
- Execute Path A + "Sniper Scouting" (DM filmmakers directly)
- Use Shopping Agreements to secure content without upfront payment
- New identity: "AI Executive Producer," not "Distributor"
- Key insight: "Hosting a conference to find 5 filmmakers is like buying a farm to get a glass of milk"

---

## The Revenue Reality Check

After Round 1, the founder ran the revenue math and discovered a problem:

### AI Shorts Distribution (Year 1)

| Deal Type | Deal Size | SI8 Commission (25%) | Volume | Annual Revenue |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|--------|----------------|
| Streaming pilot | $3-5K | $750-1,250 | 2-3 deals | $1,500-3,750 |
| Educational | $1-3K | $250-750 | 3-5 deals | $750-3,750 |
| Festival fees | $500-2K | $125-500 | 5-10 deals | $625-5,000 |
| Brand/corporate | $5-15K | $1,250-3,750 | 1-2 deals | $1,250-7,500 |
| **Total** | | | | **$4,125-20,000** |

**Realistic midpoint: ~$10-12K/year in commission revenue.**

That's not a business. That's a side hustle.

### Events Revenue (Year 1)

| Revenue Stream | Per Event | Events/Year | Annual Revenue |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Tickets | $2,625 | 4 | $10,500 |
| Sponsorships | $6,000 | 4 | $24,000 |
| VIP add-ons | $1,000 | 4 | $4,000 |
| **Total** | | | **$38,500** |

Net after costs (~$16K): **~$22,500**

**Events generate 2x the revenue of distribution.**

### The Problem

Neither path alone reaches "quit my job" money ($80-100K/year).

---

## Round 2: Revenue-Focused Feedback

Both agents were asked: "Given this revenue math, what's the fastest path to $80-100K/year?"

### ChatGPT Round 2 Response:

**Key Points:**
1. Distribution is not a revenue engine — it's credential acquisition
2. Events are better cashflow but cap out fast
3. Consulting is the revenue spine (40-50% of time)
4. Pull Path C forward, but reframe as "brand-funded AI content"
5. Target: 4-6 consulting deals at $10-15K + 1-2 brand deals at $20-40K

**Recommended Revenue Mix:**
| Stream | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Consulting/Advisory | $40-75K |
| Brand AI content deals | $20-60K |
| Events (2 max) | $10-15K |
| Distribution commissions | $5-10K |
| **Total** | **$75-120K** |

**Key Quote:** "You don't need scale, platforms, volume, community flywheels. You need a reputation for being the person who makes AI film deals actually happen — safely, legally, and credibly."

### Gemini Round 2 Response:

**Key Points:**
1. Distribution = Trojan Horse for credibility (not revenue)
2. Events = "Minimum wage when you calculate hourly rate" — KILL THEM
3. Consulting retainers = The only path that scales to $100K
4. New identity: "AI Executive Producer who helps brands build AI pipelines"
5. Use MyVideo as credibility to sell consulting, not as revenue source

**Recommended Revenue Mix:**
| Stream | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Consulting retainers (2 clients × $3K/mo) | $72,000 |
| Production oversight (2 projects × $10K) | $20,000 |
| Distribution commissions | $8,000 |
| **Total** | **$100,000** |

**Key Quote:** "Stop building a Platform (Community, Festival). Start building a Consultancy."

---

## Round 2 Consensus

Both agents agreed on:
1. **Distribution alone won't pay the bills** — loss leader, not business
2. **Consulting is the real revenue engine**
3. **Path A (MyVideo) is for credibility, not revenue**
4. **Identity shift required** — from "Distributor" to "AI Executive Producer"
5. **B2B focus** — target agencies/brands, not filmmakers/community

Both agents disagreed on:
1. **Events** — ChatGPT says keep 2, Gemini says kill entirely
2. **Path C timing** — ChatGPT says now, Gemini says after credibility

---

## Critical New Context: Founder's B2B Background

After Round 2, the founder revealed important context:

> "I have many years of experience as a B2B enterprise sales consultant. I've hosted B2B sales/coaching conferences that consistently lead to consulting work. Events → Consulting is my PROVEN playbook."

**This changes everything.**

The founder's proven sales motion:
```
Event → Attendees see founder as expert → Consulting inquiries → Retainers
```

**The reframe:**
- Events are not a time sink FOR THIS FOUNDER
- Events are the consulting funnel
- But events need to shift from B2C (filmmakers) to B2B (agencies/brands)

---

## The Events-First Hypothesis

### Old Event Model (B2C)
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Name | AI Creators Fest |
| Audience | AI filmmakers, enthusiasts |
| Purpose | Community building, filmmaker pipeline |
| Revenue | Tickets + sponsors |
| Problem | Doesn't convert to consulting |

### New Event Model (B2B)
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Name | "AI Video for Enterprise" |
| Audience | Agency execs, brand marketers, production heads |
| Purpose | Lead generation for consulting |
| Revenue | Consulting retainers (not tickets) |
| Format | Half-day executive briefing or dinner + showcase |

### The Math Changes

**Gemini's original calculation:**
- 4 events, 150 hours, $22.5K profit = "minimum wage"

**Revised calculation (events as consulting funnel):**
- 1 event: $3K cost, 40 hours
- Conversion: 2 consulting clients at $3K/month each
- Annual value: $72K from those 2 clients
- ROI: 24x

---

## Round 3 Prompts

### Prompt for ChatGPT (Round 3):

```
Thanks for the detailed analysis. Your reframing of A, B, C was helpful:
- A = Credibility acquisition
- B = Consulting funnel (if it feeds leads)
- C = Pull forward but reframe as brand-funded content
- Consulting = Revenue spine

You recommended:
- 40-50% time on consulting
- Events: "max 2, highly intentional" and "if an event doesn't generate consulting leads, don't run it"

I want to push back with important context I didn't share earlier:

**My Background:**
- I have many years of experience as a B2B enterprise sales consultant
- I've hosted B2B sales/coaching conferences that consistently lead to consulting work
- Events → Consulting is my PROVEN playbook. It's how I've sold high-ticket services before.

**My Concern:**
Without a brand name (no MyVideo deal yet, no distribution track record), cold pitching "AI video consulting" to agencies is high-risk for rejection. I've done enough B2B sales to know that cold outreach without credibility is a low-conversion game.

**My Thesis:**
For ME specifically, events aren't a time sink — they're my competitive advantage. I know how to:
- Fill a room with the right people
- Position myself as the expert (host, speaker, moderator)
- Convert attendees to consulting clients post-event

The formula that works for me:
```
Event → Attendees see me as expert → Consulting inquiries → Retainers
```

**The Reframe:**
Instead of "kill events" or "events subordinate to consulting," I'm proposing:

**Events ARE the consulting funnel.**

But the events need to shift:
- FROM: "AI Creators Fest" (B2C, filmmakers, community)
- TO: "AI Video for Enterprise" (B2B, agencies, brand marketers)

The attendee profile changes everything:
- Old: AI filmmakers looking for exposure
- New: Agency execs wondering "how do we use AI video for our clients?"

**Proposed Event Format:**
Half-day executive briefing or dinner + showcase:
- 30-50 agency/brand execs (invite-only)
- Content: "AI Video: What Brands Need to Know in 2026"
- My role: Host + primary speaker + moderator
- Conversion: 1:1 meetings scheduled at the event
- Cost: $2-5K per event

**The Revenue Model (Revised):**

| Stream | Year 1 Target | How |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Consulting (from event leads) | $50-80K | 3-5 retainers at $1.5-3K/month |
| Event sponsorships | $15-25K | Tool companies, production houses |
| Ticket revenue | $5-10K | Premium B2B pricing |
| Distribution commissions | $5-10K | MyVideo + others |
| **Total** | **$75-125K** | |

**My Questions:**

1. Given my B2B sales background and proven events → consulting motion, does this change your recommendation? Should events move from "subordinate" to "primary lead-gen channel"?

2. You said "if an event doesn't generate consulting leads, don't run it." I agree. How would you design a B2B AI event specifically optimized for consulting conversion?

3. What's the minimum credibility I need to fill a room with agency execs? Options I'm considering:
   - Jamie Lin (Taiwan Mobile Chairman) as speaker/attendee
   - Partner with existing tech/media organization
   - Tool company speakers (Runway, Kling)
   - Position as exclusive/invite-only

4. Does the B2B-focused event reframe change how you think about Path A (MyVideo) and Path C (brand work)? Are they now supporting players to the events → consulting motion?

5. What's the optimal number of B2B events per year if each event generates 1-2 consulting clients at $15-30K lifetime value?

I'm not asking you to validate my preference for events. I'm asking: given my specific background and proven playbook, is the events-first approach strategically sound? And if so, how do I optimize it?
```

---

### Prompt for Gemini (Round 3):

```
Thanks for the sharp analysis. Your "Trojan Horse" framing was useful:
- Path A (MyVideo) = Credibility, not revenue
- Events = "Minimum wage when you calculate hourly rate"
- Consulting retainers = The real revenue play
- New identity: "AI Executive Producer," not "Distributor"

You recommended killing events entirely and focusing on:
1. Close MyVideo for credibility
2. Sell consulting retainers to agencies
3. Path C emerges from retainer relationships

I want to push back with critical context I didn't share:

**My Background:**
- I have many years of experience as a B2B enterprise sales consultant
- I've hosted B2B sales/coaching conferences that consistently convert to consulting work
- Events → Consulting is my PROVEN sales motion. It's how I close high-ticket deals.

**My Concern with Your Recommendation:**
You said to pitch agencies directly using the MyVideo logo as credibility. But:
- I don't have the MyVideo deal yet
- Cold pitching "AI video consulting" without credibility is high-rejection
- I know from experience that cold B2B outreach without a platform is painful

**My Counter-Thesis:**
For ME specifically, events aren't a time sink — they're my competitive advantage.

You calculated: "$22.5K profit for 150 hours = minimum wage."

But you assumed events are ONLY for ticket/sponsor revenue. For me, events are the CONSULTING FUNNEL:

```
Event → Attendees see me as expert → Consulting inquiries → $15-30K retainers
```

If one event generates 2 consulting clients at $3K/month each, that's:
- Event cost: $3K, 40 hours
- Consulting revenue: $72K/year (2 clients × $36K)
- ROI: 24x

The math changes completely when events are lead-gen, not product.

**The Reframe:**
Instead of "AI Creators Fest" (B2C, filmmakers, community), I run:

**"AI Video for Enterprise"** (B2B, agencies, brand marketers)

| Old Model | New Model |
|-----------|-----------|
| Filmmakers + fans | Agency execs + brand marketers |
| Community building | Lead generation |
| Ticket revenue matters | Consulting conversion matters |

**Proposed Event Format:**
- Half-day executive briefing OR dinner + showcase
- 30-50 agency/brand execs (invite-only)
- Content: "AI Video: What Brands Need to Know in 2026"
- My role: Host, speaker, expert
- Conversion: 1:1 meetings at the event → consulting retainers
- Cost: $2-5K per event

**The Revised Revenue Model:**

| Stream | Year 1 Target | How |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Consulting (from event leads) | $50-80K | 3-5 retainers converted from events |
| Event sponsorships | $15-25K | Tool companies, production houses |
| Distribution commissions | $5-10K | MyVideo + others |
| **Total** | **$75-115K** | |

**My Questions:**

1. You told me to kill events because the hourly rate is minimum wage. But that assumed events = revenue. If events = consulting funnel, does the math change for you?

2. You said "pitch agencies directly using MyVideo as credibility." But without a closed deal, what credibility do I actually have? Isn't an event a faster path to credibility than cold outreach?

3. Given my proven B2B events → consulting playbook, would you revise your recommendation? Or do you still think events are wrong for this specific business?

4. How would you design a B2B AI event specifically optimized for consulting conversion? What would make agencies show up?

5. Does MyVideo become more or less important in an events-first model? Is it:
   - A) Still the critical "Trojan Horse" I need before events
   - B) A nice-to-have that accelerates events but isn't required
   - C) Something that can happen in parallel or even after events establish credibility

6. What's your honest take: Is my preference for events-first a strategic strength (playing to my proven motion) or a bias I should override (falling back on comfort zone)?

Be direct. I'm not asking for validation. I'm asking if the events-first approach is strategically sound given my specific background.
```

# PEER REVIEW ROUND 5

*Date: January 2026*

---

## Round 4 Summary: What We Learned

After Round 3 validated the events-first approach (given the founder's B2B sales background), Round 4 explored how to execute. Key developments:

1. **ChatGPT proposed "Agency of Agencies" model** — SI8 becomes the AI video production backend for multiple agencies, productizing production services

2. **Gemini validated the hybrid fireside event concept** — dual-audience events (filmmakers + agencies) reduce risk and borrow credibility from speakers

3. **Founder clarified critical distinction:**
   - **Production work** = pays the bills, but is a time sink
   - **Distribution + events** = the passion, the real business, the scalable play

4. **Founder's exact words:**
   > "I'm fine to do AI video production work to pay the bills. But I also know that's a huge time suck and have to manage staff. Ultimately, I want to be in the licensing/distribution business because that's my more recent skill set and can scale better."

   > "The website for SI8 should still be aligned around distribution and events. That's really my passion."

---

## The Two-Layer Model

Based on this clarity, the founder has adopted a **two-layer business structure**:

### Layer 1: Production Services (Private — Pays the Bills)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **What it is** | B2B AI video production for agencies and brands |
| **Revenue model** | Project fees ($5-15K), retainers ($2-5K/month) |
| **Visibility** | Private — acquired through B2B sales, not on website |
| **Passion level** | Necessary, not passion |
| **Time investment** | High (requires managing production staff/contractors) |
| **Year 1 target** | $50-70K |

**Strategic value beyond revenue:**
- Generates cash flow to fund distribution operations
- Creates filmmaker recruitment channel (hire creators → scout for roster)
- Builds agency relationships → become event attendees

### Layer 2: Distribution + Events (Public — The Real Business)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **What it is** | AI filmmaker representation, content licensing, B2B events |
| **Revenue model** | Distribution commissions (25%), event sponsorships, consulting from event leads |
| **Visibility** | Public — website, brand, marketing all focus here |
| **Passion level** | Core passion |
| **Time investment** | Lower per-deal (scalable) |
| **Year 1 target** | $30-50K |

**Strategic value:**
- Scalable (licensing doesn't require founder time at scale)
- Builds industry position and brand equity
- Creates community moat via events
- Aligns with founder's recent experience in content distribution

### How the Layers Connect

```

```

**Key insight:** Production work IS filmmaker recruitment. When SI8 hires AI creators for agency projects, those are auditions for the distribution roster. The best performers get representation offers.

### Transition Plan

| Year | Layer 1 (Production) | Layer 2 (Distribution) |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Year 1 | 60% | 40% |
| Year 2 | 40% | 60% |
| Year 3+ | 20% | 80% |

## Round 5: Feedback Request on Two-Layer Model

### Prompt for ChatGPT (Round 5):

```
Thanks for all your strategic input over the past rounds. Your "Agency of Agencies" concept was helpful — the idea of SI8 as the AI video production backend for multiple agencies.

After reflecting, I've landed on a **two-layer business model**. I'd like your feedback on whether this structure makes sense.

**THE TWO-LAYER MODEL:**

**Layer 1: Production Services (Private)**
- B2B AI video production for agencies/brands
- Revenue: Project fees ($5-15K each), retainers ($2-5K/month)
- NOT on the website — acquired through B2B sales
- This is the "pays the bills" work
- Year 1 target: $50-70K

**Layer 2: Distribution + Events (Public)**
- AI filmmaker representation, content licensing, B2B events
- Revenue: Distribution commissions, event sponsorships, consulting from event leads
- This is the PUBLIC brand — what the website showcases
- This is my passion — licensing/distribution scales better
- Year 1 target: $30-50K

**HOW THEY CONNECT:**
- Production work = filmmaker scouting (hire creators for agency work → audition for roster)
- Agency clients from production → become event attendees
- Production funds distribution until distribution scales

**TRANSITION PLAN:**
- Year 1: 60% production / 40% distribution
- Year 2: 40% production / 60% distribution
- Year 3+: 20% production / 80% distribution (the goal)

**MY RATIONALE:**
1. Distribution alone doesn't generate enough Year 1 revenue
2. Production is necessary to pay bills, but I don't want it to BE the business
3. The website/brand should represent the scalable play (distribution + events)
4. Production is a stepping stone, not the destination

**MY QUESTIONS:**

1. Does this two-layer structure make strategic sense? Or am I overcomplicating what should be simpler?

2. Is the 60/40 → 40/60 → 20/80 transition realistic? What would accelerate or block this transition?

3. How should I manage the risk that Layer 1 (production) becomes a time suck that starves Layer 2 (distribution)?

4. Should production services be completely invisible (no mention anywhere) or subtly discoverable (e.g., "custom production services available for select partners")?

5. Am I correctly identifying distribution + events as the scalable play? Or is production actually more scalable than I'm giving it credit for?

6. What's missing from this model? What risks or opportunities haven't I accounted for?

7. Given this two-layer structure, what should the website actually say? How do I position SI8 publicly while keeping production private?

Be direct and critical. I'm not looking for validation — I'm looking for holes in my thinking.

### Prompt for Gemini (Round 5):

```
Thanks for your sharp input across the rounds. Your "Trojan Horse" framing and push toward consulting were valuable.

After reflection, I've settled on a **two-layer business model**. I'd like your critique.

**THE TWO-LAYER MODEL:**

**Layer 1: Production Services (Private — Pays the Bills)**
- What: B2B AI video production for agencies/brands
- Revenue: $5-15K per project, $2-5K/month retainers
- Visibility: PRIVATE — not on website, acquired via B2B sales
- Purpose: Cash flow to fund operations; filmmaker scouting
- Year 1 target: $50-70K

**Layer 2: Distribution + Events (Public — The Real Business)**
- What: AI filmmaker representation, content licensing, B2B events
- Revenue: Distribution commissions (25%), event sponsorships, event-to-consulting conversions
- Visibility: PUBLIC — website, brand, all marketing
- Purpose: Scalable business; builds industry position
- Year 1 target: $30-50K

**THE CONNECTION:**
```
Production Services (Layer 1)  →→→  Distribution & Events (Layer 2)
         ↓                                    ↓
   Pays the bills                      Builds the platform
         ↓                                    ↓
   Hire AI creators            →→→     Scout for representation
         ↓                                    ↓
   Agency relationships        →→→     Event attendees + clients
```

**KEY INSIGHT:** Production work = filmmaker auditions. When I hire AI creators for agency projects, I'm scouting for the distribution roster.

**TRANSITION PLAN:**
- Year 1: 60% production / 40% distribution
- Year 2: 40% production / 60% distribution
- Year 3+: 20% production / 80% distribution (goal state)

**MY RATIONALE:**
1. You were right that distribution alone can't fund the business in Year 1
2. Production generates immediate revenue, but I know it's a time suck
3. The public brand (website, positioning) should reflect the scalable play — distribution
4. Production is bridge financing, not the destination
5. I'm leveraging my line producer background (20 years ago in LA) for Layer 1

**MY QUESTIONS:**

1. Is this two-layer model strategically sound? Or am I building unnecessary complexity?

2. You previously argued for "AI Executive Producer" identity. Does this two-layer model conflict with that identity, or can they coexist? Am I:
   - A) AI Executive Producer publicly (production identity)
   - B) AI Film Distributor publicly (distribution identity)
   - C) Something hybrid

3. You've pushed hard for focus. Does this two-layer model represent smart diversification or dangerous distraction?

4. How do I prevent Layer 1 (production) from consuming all my time and starving Layer 2 (distribution)?

5. Is the "production as filmmaker scouting" insight valid? Or is it a rationalization to justify taking production work?

6. What would make you confident this model will work? What signals should I watch for?

7. What's the biggest risk I'm not seeing?

Be direct. I'm not looking for encouragement — I'm looking for the holes.

## What We're Testing in Round 5

| Question | What We Need to Learn |
|----------|----------------------|
| Is two-layer strategically sound? | Does having private/public layers make sense, or is it overengineered? |
| Production as scouting | Is "hire creators → scout for roster" a real synergy or rationalization? |
| Transition risk | What could trap the founder in Layer 1 forever? |
| Identity clarity | How does the public brand work when Layer 1 is private? |
| Missing risks | What haven't we considered? |

## Round 5 Results: ChatGPT & Gemini Responses

### ChatGPT Round 5 Key Points:

1. **Two-layer is valid** — "cash engine + equity engine" structure that many media/agency businesses use
2. **Critical addition: Bridge Product** — need a product that converts Layer 2 attention to cash before distribution matures (membership council, advisory sprint, enablement kit)
3. **Productize Layer 1** — two packages only:
   - AI Video Pilot Sprint ($8-15K, 30 days)
   - Agency AI Video Retainer ($2.5-7.5K/month tiers)
4. **Cap capacity** — max 2 retainers + 1 sprint at any time
5. **Make production subtly discoverable** — not hidden, but prestige-coded ("select partnerships available")
6. **Website positioning:**
   - Core: "SI8 helps AI filmmakers and brands navigate creation, rights, and distribution"
   - Path 1 (Public): Distribution & Programs
   - Path 2 (B2B doorway): "Select partnerships available" → lead form
7. **Transition blockers:** If Layer 2 doesn't become recurring, 20/80 goal will slide

**Key quote:** "SI8 is the trusted operator at the intersection of AI creators, rights, and commercial deployment."

### Gemini Round 5 Key Points:

1. **Model validated** — "Service-Funded Product" model is correct survival strategy without outside funding
2. **Identity solution:** "AI Talent & Production Studio" — represent filmmakers (distribution) AND deploy them to solve brand challenges (production)
3. **Critical rule:** Layer 1 must utilize Layer 2 talent — don't become a freelancer prompting Midjourney yourself
4. **General Contractor Rule:** Never touch the tools. Only scope, staff, and QC.
5. **Friday Rule:** 20% of week protected exclusively for Layer 2 activities
6. **Reframe:** Production isn't "scouting" — it's "Loyalty Buying." Pay filmmakers first, then ask for representation.
7. **Conflict of Interest warning:** As distributor, duty is highest price for filmmaker. As producer, incentive is lowest price. Be transparent on splits.
8. **Signals of success:**
   - Creator hired for commercial introduces you to another creator for roster
   - Agency hires you for project, then asks to license creator's previous work
   - Spending <3 hours per $1,000 revenue

**Key quote:** "Stop planning. Book the venue. Start the pre-sell calls."

### Round 5 Consensus

| Topic | Agreement |
|-------|-----------|
| Two-layer validity | ✅ Both validate as correct survival structure |
| Production risk | ✅ Both warn: must productize and cap, or it traps you |
| Identity | ✅ Hybrid works — represent + deploy |
| Production-as-scouting | ⚠️ Partially valid — Gemini reframes as "Loyalty Buying" |
| Transition timeline | ✅ 60/40 realistic; 40/60 needs recurring Layer 2; 20/80 needs flywheel |
| Bridge product | ✅ ChatGPT emphasizes this as critical missing piece |
| Conflict of interest | ✅ Gemini flags transparency as essential |

### Round 5 Synthesis: What We Learned

**The model is sound, but needs guardrails:**

1. **Productize or die** — Layer 1 must be 2 fixed packages, capped capacity, no custom chaos
2. **Bridge product is critical** — need something that monetizes Layer 2 attention before distribution matures
3. **General Contractor Rule** — founder never touches tools; scope, staff, QC only
4. **Friday Rule** — 20% of time protected for Layer 2 or it starves
5. **Loyalty Buying** — production isn't just scouting; it's earning the right to ask for representation
6. **Transparency on splits** — conflict of interest is real; be upfront with filmmakers

**Website positioning (adopted):**
- Core: "SI8 helps AI filmmakers and brands navigate creation, rights, and distribution"
- Tagline: "The trusted operator at the intersection of AI creators, rights, and commercial deployment"
- Two paths: Distribution & Programs (public) + Partnerships (subtle B2B doorway)

**Next actions (per Gemini):**
- Stop planning
- Book venue/date for first event
- Start pre-sell calls to agencies
- Find the first production project

## Round 6: Execution Gap Review

**Focus:** Strategy is locked. Round 6 focuses on identifying gaps in the EXECUTION plan.

### Prompt for ChatGPT (Round 6):

Provided full context on:
- Two-layer model (locked)
- Parallel tracks geographic strategy (locked)
- 66 execution gaps across 13 categories
- Constraints: 10-15 hrs/week, solo founder, 6-month timeline

**Ask:** Identify missing execution gaps, prioritization issues, hidden dependencies, what will break first, and first 30 days priorities.

### ChatGPT Round 6 Key Points:

**Missing execution gaps identified:**

1. **Sales Ops:**
   - Lead intake + qualification form
   - CRM pipeline stages (6 max)
   - Proposal template (<45 min per proposal)
   - Pricing guardrails ("if X then quote Y")
   - Follow-up sequence (7 touches over 21 days)

2. **Delivery Ops:**
   - Production Brief Template
   - Creative QA Checklist
   - Revision policy enforcement ("2 rounds max")
   - Creator bench agreement (2-3 freelancers)
   - Asset management system (folder structure)

3. **Legal Ops:**
   - Standard MSA + SOW
   - Creator contractor agreement (work-for-hire + IP)
   - Rights rider (safe lane restrictions)
   - Client approval language

4. **Comms/Brand Ops:**
   - Intro blurb (100 words)
   - One-pager PDF
   - Case study template

5. **Event Ops:**
   - Sponsor kit
   - Speaker management
   - Attendee conversion system
   - List-building mechanism (Month 1)

**What's unrealistic with 10-15 hrs/week:**
- Multiple SEA markets simultaneously — pick ONE (Singapore)
- Building "full" rights playbook — make it iterative (v0.1 = 3 pages)
- Running 5+ initiatives in parallel

**Hidden dependencies:**
1. MyVideo warm lead ≠ deal execution (need internal champion, legal, budget)
2. Need 2-3 reliable creators BEFORE selling production
3. Event success depends on distribution list built in Month 1
4. Offers require credibility artifacts (samples, reel, case writeups)

**First 30 days — the 7 things that matter:**
1. Launch website v1 in 7 days (not perfect)
2. Produce 3 credibility assets (reel, deck, Rights Playbook v0.1)
3. Lock delivery system (templates, folders, revision process)
4. Build Singapore target list (100 agencies)
5. Start outreach: 10/day, 5 days/week
6. Pre-sell event "industry seats"
7. Define "No List" (safe lane boundaries)

**What will break first:**
1. 🔥 Production scope creep (fix: enforce package constraints)
2. 🔥 Too many workstreams (fix: stable weekly operating cadence)
3. 🔥 Event becomes a sink (fix: outsource logistics)
4. 🔥 Overbuilding rights playbook (fix: only write what helps sell THIS month)

**Suggested weekly time allocation:**
- 5 hrs: Revenue outreach + calls (non-negotiable)
- 3 hrs: Delivery system + creator bench
- 2 hrs: Website + credibility assets
- 2 hrs: Event planning
- 1 hr: Rights playbook

**Critical insight:** "If you go below 5 hrs/week on outreach, you likely miss $5K/month by Month 6."

### Round 6 Synthesis: What We Incorporated

**Geographic focus narrowed:**
- Month 1-2: Singapore ONLY (not all of SEA)
- Expand to other markets only after playbook is proven

**"No List" defined:**
- No celebrity likeness
- No voice cloning
- No explicit IP imitation
- No projects without signed brief
- No projects without creator capacity

**Time allocation locked:**
- 5 hrs/week outreach is non-negotiable
- Rights playbook iterates slowly (1 hr/week max)

**Delivery ops prioritized:**
- Lock system BEFORE scaling outreach
- 2 revision rounds max, enforced strictly
- Creator bench needed before selling

**Event strategy refined:**
- List-building starts Month 1 (not Month 3)
- Outsource logistics to contractor
- Founder owns: speakers, content, conversion

**Rights Playbook approach:**
- v0.1 (Month 1): 3 pages
- v0.2 (Month 2-3): 8 pages
- v1.0 (Month 6): Full playbook
- Only write what helps sell THIS month
