# SuperImmersive 8 — 6-Month Execution Plan

**Period:** February 2026 — July 2026
**Founder Context:** Part-time (10-15 hours/week), solo execution, based in Taipei
**Primary Goal:** Reach $5K/month stable revenue to enable full-time transition

---

## Strategic Framework

### The Two-Layer Model

| Layer | What | Target Market | Language | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------------|----------|---------|
| **Layer 1: Production** | B2B AI video production for agencies | SEA agencies (primary), Taiwan agencies (secondary) | English (primary), Mandarin (secondary) | Pays the bills, scouts filmmakers |
| **Layer 2: Distribution** | Filmmaker representation, licensing, events | Global filmmakers, APAC platforms | English (primary) | Builds the scalable platform |

### Geographic Strategy: Parallel Tracks

**Track 1: MyVideo / Taiwan (Distribution Credibility)**
- **Why:** Warm lead with Jamie Lin (Chairman, Taiwan Mobile) — closeable in 60-90 days
- **Strategic value:** "We program AI shorts for Taiwan Mobile" opens every door
- **Language:** Traditional Mandarin (with Jamie Lin relationship, English may work)
- **Events:** All in-person events are Taipei-based
- **Goal:** Close pilot deal by Month 3 → use as credibility for everything else

**Track 2: SEA Agencies (Production Revenue)**
- **Why:** Larger agency budgets, familiar with global AI tools, English as business language
- **Target cities:** Singapore (priority), Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Jakarta
- **Outreach:** Remote/digital (LinkedIn, email, video calls)
- **Goal:** 2 retainer clients by Month 6 → $5K+/month production revenue

**How the Tracks Reinforce Each Other:**
```
MyVideo Deal (Month 2-3)
        ↓
"We're on Taiwan Mobile's platform"
        ↓
SEA agencies take you seriously
        ↓
Production deals close faster
        ↓
Hire filmmakers for agency work
        ↓
Sign filmmakers for distribution
        ↓
More content for MyVideo
```

**Filmmaker Scouting: Global (English-Speaking)**
- **Why:** Best AI filmmakers are globally distributed, mostly English-speaking
- **Sources:** Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, Runway community, Curious Refuge alumni
- **Priority:** SEA-based filmmakers (can hire for agency work + sign for distribution)
- **Focus:** Quality and professionalism over geography

### Legal & Rights Infrastructure (Core Competency)

**Why this matters:**
SI8's positioning is "the trusted operator" who helps creators and brands navigate AI video **safely and legally**. This requires deep understanding of the evolving AI content legal landscape — not just contracts, but the underlying rights issues.

**The moat:** Most agencies and filmmakers are confused about AI rights. If SI8 becomes the expert who can answer "Is this legal? Is this brand-safe? What rights do we need?" — that's a defensible competitive advantage.

**Key areas to master:**

| Area | Why It Matters | Who Cares |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **AI Copyright (by jurisdiction)** | Can AI-generated content be copyrighted? Who owns it? | Filmmakers, platforms |
| **Training Data Rights** | Was the AI model trained legally? Liability exposure? | Agencies, brands |
| **Likeness & Voice Rights** | Using real people's faces/voices in AI content | Brands, agencies |
| **Platform Policies** | What do streaming platforms require/prohibit for AI content? | Distribution deals |
| **Disclosure Requirements** | When must content be labeled as AI-generated? | Brands, platforms |
| **Music & Audio Rights** | AI-generated music, sound effects, voice cloning | All productions |
| **Brand Safety** | What makes AI content "safe" for brand association? | Agencies, brands |
| **International Differences** | US vs EU vs APAC regulations | Cross-border deals |

**Deliverable by Month 6:** "AI Video Rights Playbook" — internal document (potentially productizable) that covers:
- Current legal landscape summary
- Rights checklist for productions
- Platform-by-platform requirements
- Risk assessment framework
- Standard contract clauses

**This becomes a sales asset:**
> "We've done the legal homework so you don't have to. Here's our rights clearance process."

### Time Budget

**10-15 hours/week = 40-60 hours/month = 240-360 hours over 6 months**

| Activity | Hours/Week | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **Revenue outreach + calls** | 5 hrs | Non-negotiable. Below 5 hrs = miss $5K/month target. |
| **Delivery system + creator bench** | 3 hrs | Templates, QC, creator relationships |
| **Website + credibility assets** | 2 hrs | Iterate, don't perfect |
| **Event planning** | 2 hrs | Only if Month 3 event scheduled |
| **Rights playbook** | 1 hr | Iterate slowly — only what helps sell THIS month |

**Critical rule:** If you go below 5 hrs/week on outreach, you likely miss $5K/month by Month 6.

### The "No List" — Safe Lane Boundaries

*What SI8 will NOT do (prevents scope creep and risk):*

- ❌ No celebrity likeness (real people's faces without consent)
- ❌ No voice cloning of real people
- ❌ No explicit IP imitation (copyrighted characters, brands)
- ❌ No political persuasion content
- ❌ No deepfakes or deceptive content
- ❌ No adult/explicit content
- ❌ No projects without signed brief (clients must fill intake form)
- ❌ No projects without creator bench capacity (don't sell what you can't deliver)

### Geographic Focus (Refined)

**Month 1-2: Singapore ONLY**
- Trying Singapore + Manila + KL + Bangkok + Jakarta simultaneously = getting none
- Pick ONE city first, prove the model, then expand

**Month 3+: Expand to other SEA markets** (only after Singapore playbook is working)

### Revenue Targets (6-Month)

| Stream | Month 1-2 | Month 3-4 | Month 5-6 | 6-Month Total |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Production (Layer 1) | $0 | $5-10K | $10-15K | $15-25K |
| Distribution (Layer 2) | $0 | $0 | $1-3K | $1-3K |
| Event sponsorships | $0 | $2-5K | $2-5K | $4-10K |
| **Total** | $0 | $7-15K | $13-23K | **$20-38K** |

**Exit criteria for Month 6:** On track for $5K/month run rate

---

## Key Dependencies (Hidden Killers)

*These are the silent killers that break early-stage builds:*

| Dependency | Risk | Mitigation |
|------------|------|------------|
| **MyVideo ≠ deal execution** | Warm lead ≠ closed deal. Need: internal champion, legal review, programming needs, budget owner, timeline alignment | 60-90 days realistic, but don't let Track 1 stall Track 2 |
| **Need creator bench before selling** | Can't sell "delivery engine" without delivery capacity | Build 2-3 creator relationships BEFORE scaling outreach |
| **Event success = distribution list** | No list = weak attendance | List-building mechanism in Month 1, not just Month 2 |
| **Offers require credibility artifacts** | Agencies need: 2-3 samples, 1 showreel, 1-2 case writeups | Even mock/personal projects work — but you need them |

---

## What Will Break First

*These break first in 90% of services + brand businesses:*

**🔥 #1: Production scope creep**
- Client keeps "just one more tweak" → you lose 3 weeks → Layer 2 dies
- **Fix:** Enforce package constraints + revision limits strictly

**🔥 #2: Too many workstreams (context switching)**
- Start 6 initiatives, finish none
- **Fix:** Stable weekly operating cadence. Same activities, same days.

**🔥 #3: Event becomes a time sink**
- Logistics eats you alive
- **Fix:** Outsource event operations early. Venue + drinks + ticketing = contractor. You only own: speakers, content, conversion.

**🔥 #4: Overbuilding rights playbook**
- Disappear into writing instead of selling
- **Fix:** Only write what helps sell THIS month. v0.1 = 3 pages.

**🔥 #5: MyVideo stalls and blocks everything**
- Track 1 delay → Track 2 stalls → nothing happens
- **Fix:** Run parallel. Don't let Track 1 stall Track 2.

---

## Month 1: February 2026 — Foundation

**Theme:** "Ship fast, start outreach, build credibility"
**Hours:** 40-50 hours

### First 30 Days — The 7 Things That Matter

*If you only nail these, the entire plan becomes viable:*

| # | Item | Deliverable |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Launch website v1 in 7 days** | Positioning, 2 paths, 1 lead form, 1 calendar link, "AI Rights safe lane" blurb. Not perfect. |
| 2 | **Produce 3 credibility assets** | 60-sec sizzle reel, 10-slide deck OR 1-page PDF, Rights Playbook v0.1 (3 pages) |
| 3 | **Lock delivery system** | Brief template, revision doc format, file organization, creator contract template |
| 4 | **Build Singapore target list** | 100 agencies with: name, founder/partner, email, LinkedIn, niche, 1 reason why them |
| 5 | **Start outreach: 10/day, 5 days/week** | 50 touches/week. Book calls in Week 3-4. |
| 6 | **Pre-sell event "industry seats"** | Start booking B2B attendees early. Make them feel scarce. |
| 7 | **Define your "No List"** | Safe lane boundaries documented. |

### Legal Infrastructure (CRITICAL)

**Contracts (with lawyer):**
- [ ] Find entertainment lawyer (Taiwan + US/international experience, AI-aware)
- [ ] Draft Filmmaker Shopping Agreement (non-exclusive representation)
- [ ] Draft Production Services Agreement (for agency clients)
- [ ] Draft basic Content Licensing Agreement template

**Legal Research (self-directed — iterate, don't perfect):**
- [ ] AI Copyright landscape: US Copyright Office guidance, recent cases
- [ ] Platform policies: Research YouTube, TikTok policies on AI content
- [ ] Create **Rights Playbook v0.1 (3 pages max)**:
  - Safe lane rules (what we will/won't do)
  - Key contract clauses
  - Platform policy summary

**Time:** 12-15 hours (contracts + research)
**Cost:** $2,000-4,000 (lawyer fees)
**Deliverables:**
- Usable contracts for both layers
- Rights Playbook v0.1 (3 pages — NOT comprehensive, just what you need to sell)

**Note:** Don't disappear into writing. Only write what helps sell THIS month. Playbook grows iteratively:
- v0.1 (Month 1): 3 pages
- v0.2 (Month 2-3): 8 pages
- v1.0 (Month 6): Full playbook

### Website Launch (Ship in 7 days — not perfect)
- [ ] Positioning + 2 paths (Programs/Partnerships)
- [ ] Lead intake form (one link for everyone)
- [ ] Calendar link for booking calls
- [ ] "AI Rights safe lane" blurb (signals expertise)
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Deploy to Netlify/Vercel

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Cost:** $0-50
**Rule:** Ship in 7 days. Iterate later. Perfectionism kills momentum.

### Credibility Assets (Before outreach begins)
- [ ] 60-second sizzle reel (sample AI video work)
- [ ] 10-slide deck OR 1-page PDF (agency-facing)
- [ ] 2-3 sample AI video outputs (even mock/personal projects)
- [ ] Case study template ready (Problem → Approach → Output → Lessons)

**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Why:** Agencies need credibility artifacts. These turn cold outreach into warm conversations.

### Sales Ops Setup (This makes or breaks Month 2-6)
- [ ] Lead intake + qualification form (company, role, budget range, use case, timeline)
- [ ] CRM + pipeline stages (6 max): Prospect → Contacted → Meeting Booked → Proposal Sent → Negotiation → Won/Lost
- [ ] Proposal template (1-page + SOW) — must take <45 min per proposal
- [ ] Pricing guardrails: "if X then quote Y" (e.g., "Hero film + cutdowns = $12K baseline")

**Time:** 3-4 hours

### Delivery Ops Setup (Before you sell aggressively)
- [ ] Production Brief Template (objective, audience, tone, prompt constraints, do-not-do list)
- [ ] Creative QA Checklist (branding, rights lane, motion stability, audio, specs)
- [ ] Revision policy: "2 rounds max", "only 1 consolidated revision doc"
- [ ] Asset folder structure: /Client/Project/01_briefs, /02_versions, /03_deliverables_final
- [ ] Identify 2-3 potential creators for bench (relationships, not contracts yet)

**Time:** 4-5 hours
**Why:** Production scope creep is the #1 failure mode. Lock this BEFORE scaling outreach.

### Singapore Agency Research (Layer 1 — Primary)
- [ ] Build target list: **100 Singapore agencies** (ONE market, go deep)
- [ ] Focus: Digital agencies, content agencies, performance marketing agencies
- [ ] For each: name, founder/partner, email, LinkedIn, niche, 1 reason why them
- [ ] Research via LinkedIn, agency directories, industry publications
- [ ] Identify decision makers (Creative Directors, Heads of Production, MDs)

**Time:** 8-10 hours
**Deliverable:** 100-agency Singapore target list

**Why Singapore only:** Trying Singapore + Manila + KL + Bangkok + Jakarta = getting none. Pick ONE city, prove the model, then expand in Month 3+.

### Taiwan Agency Research (Layer 1 — Secondary)
- [ ] Build target list: 15 Taiwan agencies
- [ ] Focus: Agencies serving international brands, tech-forward agencies
- [ ] Leverage existing network where possible

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Deliverable:** 15-agency target list

### Filmmaker Research (Layer 2)
- [ ] Build target list: 30 AI filmmakers to potentially sign
- [ ] Criteria: Quality work, 5K+ followers, active, professional, English-speaking
- [ ] Sources: Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, Runway community
- [ ] Categorize: Tier 1 (reach first), Tier 2, Tier 3
- [ ] Note: Geographic distribution (SEA filmmakers = bonus for agency work)

**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Deliverable:** 30-filmmaker target list

### MyVideo / Taiwan Mobile (PRIORITY — Track 1)
- [ ] Draft proposal for Jamie Lin: Curated AI shorts pilot program
  - Concept: 5-10 AI shorts, 30-minute programming block
  - Ask: Pilot commitment for Q2/Q3 2026
  - Positioning: "First AI film program on a major Taiwan streaming platform"
- [ ] Research MyVideo's current content strategy and gaps
- [ ] Prepare supporting materials (filmmaker reel, content samples)
- [ ] Send proposal by end of Month 1

**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Deliverable:** MyVideo proposal sent to Jamie Lin
**Why this matters:** A "yes" from MyVideo changes every conversation that follows.

### Other Distribution Channels (Layer 2)
- [ ] SEA streaming research: Viu, iQIYI, regional OTT platforms
- [ ] FAST channels: Samsung TV Plus, LG Channels (APAC)
- [ ] Educational: SEA universities, Taiwan universities, corporate training

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Deliverable:** Channel target list for future outreach

### Month 1 Checkpoint

**Must have by end of Month 1:**
- [ ] Usable legal agreements (both layers)
- [ ] Website live
- [ ] **MyVideo proposal sent to Jamie Lin** ← Top priority
- [ ] 30 SEA agency targets identified
- [ ] 30 filmmaker targets identified

**Go/No-Go:** If no legal agreements ready, delay outreach until they are.

**Parallel Tracks Status:**
- Track 1 (MyVideo): Proposal sent, awaiting response
- Track 2 (SEA): Target list ready, outreach begins Month 2

---

## Month 2: March 2026 — First Outreach

**Theme:** "Start conversations on both layers"
**Hours:** 45-55 hours

### Singapore Agency Outreach (Layer 1 — PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Outreach cadence: 10/day, 5 days/week = 50/week = 200/month**
- [ ] Method: LinkedIn + email, personalized to their work/clients
- [ ] Pitch: "AI video production partner for agencies — we handle creation, you handle client"
- [ ] **Follow-up sequence: 7 touchpoints over 21 days** (prewritten/templated)
- [ ] Track: Response rates, objections, interest level
- [ ] Book calls in Week 3-4

**Outreach assets (created in Month 1):**
- [x] LinkedIn connection message template
- [x] Follow-up email sequence (7 touches)
- [x] One-pager PDF
- [x] Sizzle reel

**Time:** 12-15 hours
**Goal:** 5+ discovery calls scheduled; >10% response rate

### Taiwan Agency Outreach (Layer 1 — Secondary)
- [ ] Reach out to 10-15 Taiwan agencies
- [ ] Leverage warm intros from network where possible
- [ ] Bilingual pitch (English + Mandarin as appropriate)
- [ ] Lower priority than Singapore — only if time permits

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Goal:** 2-3 conversations

### Event List Building (CRITICAL — Start NOW)
- [ ] Begin building attendee list for Month 3 event
- [ ] Pre-sell "industry seats" even before final lineup confirmed
- [ ] Target: 20+ committed attendees before Month 3
- [ ] Make seats feel scarce ("limited to 25 industry executives")

**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Why:** Event success depends on distribution list. No list = weak attendance. Start in Month 2, not Month 3.

### Filmmaker Outreach (Layer 2)
- [ ] Reach out to 15-20 Tier 1 filmmakers
- [ ] Pitch: "Building AI film distribution with APAC focus — interested in representation?"
- [ ] Lead with: Distribution relationships (MyVideo, festivals, platforms)
- [ ] Note: SEA-based filmmakers = priority (can also hire for agency work)

**Time:** 8-10 hours
**Goal:** 5+ conversations, 1-2 soft commits

### MyVideo Follow-Up (PRIORITY — Track 1)
- [ ] Follow up with Jamie Lin on proposal
- [ ] If positive: Get LOI or written commitment for pilot
- [ ] If needs more: Offer to present in person, bring content samples
- [ ] If meeting scheduled: Prepare pitch deck, filmmaker showcase
- [ ] Identify internal champion (content head, programming director)

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Goal:** LOI or clear commitment by end of Month 2
**Why this matters:** MyVideo "yes" = instant credibility for SEA agency conversations

### Event Planning — First B2B Event
- [ ] Set date for first event (target: mid-April)
- [ ] Format decision: B2B dinner/roundtable (15-25 people) vs. hybrid showcase
- [ ] Venue research: Hotels, co-working spaces, private dining in Taipei
- [ ] Theme: "AI Video for Brands: What Agencies Need to Know in 2026"
- [ ] Invite list: Mix of SEA + Taiwan agency contacts, plus local creatives
- [ ] Consider: Can MyVideo/Taiwan Mobile content head be a speaker?

**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Goal:** Date, venue, and format confirmed

### Legal Research (Ongoing)
- [ ] Research likeness/voice rights: What are the rules for AI-generated faces/voices?
- [ ] Interview 1-2 filmmakers: What legal concerns do they have?
- [ ] Research APAC-specific regulations: Taiwan, Singapore, any emerging rules?
- [ ] Update "AI Video Rights Playbook" with findings
- [ ] Identify 2-3 legal edge cases to discuss with lawyer

**Time:** 2-3 hours

### Content & Brand Building
- [ ] LinkedIn content: 2-3 posts/week about AI video for brands
- [ ] r/aifilmreviews: Continue 2x/week cadence
- [ ] Document learnings from outreach (for future content)
- [ ] **Consider:** 1 LinkedIn post on AI video legal landscape (positions you as expert)

**Time:** 4-6 hours

### Month 2 Checkpoint

**Parallel Tracks Status:**

| Track | Metric | Target | Actual |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Track 1: MyVideo** | Status | LOI or clear signal | |
| Track 2: SEA Agencies | Outreach sent | 15-20 | |
| Track 2: SEA Agencies | Response rate | >10% | |
| Track 2: SEA Agencies | Discovery calls | 5+ | |
| Layer 2: Filmmakers | Conversations | 5+ | |

**Scenario planning:**
- **MyVideo YES + SEA traction:** Full speed ahead, use MyVideo in all SEA pitches
- **MyVideo YES + SEA slow:** Lead with MyVideo credibility, adjust SEA messaging
- **MyVideo slow + SEA traction:** Focus on SEA, keep MyVideo warm
- **Both slow:** Reassess targeting and messaging

**Warning signs:**
- <10% response rate from SEA agencies = messaging problem
- Zero discovery calls = targeting or offer problem
- MyVideo going dark = need to re-engage through different channel

---

## Month 3: April 2026 — First Event + First Deals

**Theme:** "Run the event, close first production deal"
**Hours:** 50-60 hours (event-intensive month)

### First B2B Event (KEY MILESTONE)
- [ ] Execute first event (target: 20-30 attendees)
- [ ] Attendee mix: 50% agency/brand execs, 50% AI creators/enthusiasts
- [ ] Format: Keynote/panel + AI film showcase + networking
- [ ] Your role: Host, moderator, primary expert
- [ ] Capture: Photos, testimonials, contact info
- [ ] Post-event: Follow-up emails, meeting requests

**Event goals:**
- 20+ attendees
- 3-5 follow-up meetings with agency execs
- Content for social proof
- 1+ potential sponsor conversation

**Time:** 20-25 hours (including prep)
**Cost:** $1,000-2,000 (venue, F&B, AV)

### Production Deal Close (Layer 1 — Track 2)
- [ ] Convert discovery calls to proposals
- [ ] Target: Close 1 production deal (Sprint or Retainer)
- [ ] Pricing: Sprint $8-10K, Retainer $2.5-3K/month
- [ ] **If MyVideo closed:** Lead with "We program AI content for Taiwan Mobile"
- [ ] If deal closes: Immediately hire AI creators from filmmaker pipeline
- [ ] Document process for repeatability

**Time:** 10-12 hours
**Goal:** 1 signed production deal OR 2+ proposals out

**The MyVideo multiplier:** If MyVideo pilot is confirmed by Month 3, your SEA pitch becomes:
> "We're the team behind Taiwan Mobile's AI shorts program. We help agencies produce AI video for their clients."

That's a different conversation than cold outreach.

### Filmmaker Signing (Layer 2)
- [ ] Convert conversations to signed Shopping Agreements
- [ ] Target: 3-5 filmmakers signed by end of month
- [ ] Priority: Filmmakers who can also do agency work (dual value)
- [ ] Onboard: Catalog their work, understand their goals

**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Goal:** 3+ filmmakers signed

### Distribution Channel Progress (Layer 2)
- [ ] MyVideo: Push for decision or pilot commitment
- [ ] Educational: Pitch 3-5 SEA/Taiwan universities
- [ ] Festivals: Submit represented work to 2-3 AI festivals

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Goal:** 1 channel moving toward commitment

### Legal & Rights Development
- [ ] Document legal questions from filmmaker/agency conversations
- [ ] Research platform requirements: What does MyVideo require for AI content?
- [ ] Create "Rights Checklist" for production projects (1-pager)
- [ ] Draft "Brand Safety Guidelines" for agency clients
- [ ] Update "AI Video Rights Playbook"

**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Deliverable:** Rights Checklist v1 for production projects

### Month 3 Checkpoint

**Validation scorecard:**

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Event attendance | 20+ | |
| Follow-up meetings from event | 3+ | |
| Production deals closed | 1 | |
| Production proposals out | 2+ | |
| Filmmakers signed | 3+ | |
| Distribution channels in discussion | 2+ | |

**Decision point:** If zero production interest after 20+ agency conversations, reassess Layer 1 approach.

---

## Month 4: May 2026 — Revenue Ramp

**Theme:** "Build production revenue, second event"
**Hours:** 50-60 hours

### Production Revenue (Layer 1 — PRIORITY)
- [ ] If first deal closed: Deliver excellent work, document case study
- [ ] Continue agency outreach: 10-15 new contacts
- [ ] Target: 1-2 more production deals (Sprint or Retainer)

**Time:** 15-20 hours
**Goal:** $5-10K production revenue this month; 2+ active projects

### Second B2B Event
- [ ] Second event (target: 30-40 attendees)
- [ ] Iterate based on first event feedback
- [ ] More aggressive sponsor outreach (target: 1 paying sponsor)
- [ ] Content: Feature case study from first production project
- [ ] Invite more SEA agency execs (offer virtual attendance option?)

**Time:** 15-20 hours
**Cost:** $1,000-2,500
**Goal:** 1 paying sponsor; 3+ consulting/production leads

### Filmmaker Roster Growth (Layer 2)

- [ ] Filmmakers from production projects → sign for distribution
- [ ] Start matching filmmakers to distribution opportunities

**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Goal:** 8 filmmakers on roster

### Distribution Progress (Layer 2)
- [ ] MyVideo: If pilot approved, curate first content package
- [ ] Educational: Close 1 licensing deal (even small)
- [ ] Festival results: Track submissions, leverage acceptances

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Goal:** 1 distribution deal closed OR MyVideo pilot underway

### Sponsor Development
- [ ] Create sponsor deck for events
- [ ] Outreach to 5-10 potential sponsors (AI tool companies, agencies)

**Time:** 4-6 hours

### Legal & Rights Systematization
- [ ] Refine "Rights Checklist" based on first production project learnings
- [ ] Document any legal issues encountered and how resolved

- [ ] Update "AI Video Rights Playbook"

**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Goal:** Rights process documented enough to repeat reliably

### Month 4 Checkpoint

**Revenue check:**

| Stream | Month 4 Actual | Run Rate |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| Production | $_____ | |
| Distribution | $_____ | |
| Sponsorship | $_____ | |
| **Total** | $_____ | |

**On track for $5K/month by Month 6?**

---

## Month 5: June 2026 — Scale or Adjust

**Theme:** "Double down on what's working"
**Hours:** 50-60 hours

### Production Scale (Layer 1)
- [ ] If production is working: Push for 2 retainer clients ($5-6K/month recurring)
- [ ] Systematize: Create SOPs for project delivery
- [ ] Build creator bench: 3-5 reliable AI creators for fulfillment
- [ ] Consider: Can you raise prices? Add premium tier?

**Time:** 15-20 hours
**Goal:** $8-12K production revenue this month

### Distribution Validation (Layer 2)
- [ ] MyVideo: Content delivered, measure results
- [ ] Close 1-2 more distribution deals (educational, festival, brand)
- [ ] Pay filmmakers their share (75%) — creates case study

**Time:** 8-10 hours
**Goal:** 1+ closed distribution deal; filmmakers paid

### Third Event (or Skip to Plan Q3)
- [ ] If momentum good: Third event, potentially larger format
- [ ] If events draining: Pause events, focus on 1:1 sales
- [ ] Decision: Are events converting to revenue? If not, cut.

**Time:** 10-15 hours (if running event)

### Consulting Pipeline (Bridge Product)
- [ ] From event leads: Convert 1-2 to consulting engagements
- [ ] Offer: "AI Video Strategy Sprint" — 2-week engagement, $3-5K
- [ ] **Include legal/rights guidance as key value-add**
- [ ] This bridges Layer 2 to cash before distribution scales

**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Goal:** 1 consulting engagement closed

### Legal & Rights Productization
- [ ] Finalize "AI Video Rights Playbook" v1.0
- [ ] Create client-facing "Rights & Risk Assessment" one-pager
- [ ] Test: Use legal knowledge as sales differentiator in agency conversations
- [ ] Consider: "Rights & Risk Audit" as standalone consulting offering ($2-3K)
- [ ] Gather testimonials: "SI8 helped us navigate the legal complexity"

**Time:** 3-4 hours
**Goal:** Legal expertise becomes explicit sales asset

### Month 5 Checkpoint

**Critical question:** Can you see a path to $5K/month?

| Scenario | Revenue Mix | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Production working, distribution slow | $4-5K production | Double down on production |
| Both working | $3K production + $2K distribution | Balanced growth |
| Neither working | <$2K total | Serious reassessment |

---

## Month 6: July 2026 — Assessment + H2 Planning

**Theme:** "Honest assessment. Decide next phase."
**Hours:** 40-50 hours

### 6-Month Validation Assessment

**Complete this scorecard:**

| Metric | Target | Actual | Notes |

## Success Definition

**End of Month 6, success looks like:**

1. **Revenue:** $5K/month run rate (combination of production + distribution + consulting)
2. **Track 1 (MyVideo):** Pilot program live or committed; content delivered
3. **Track 2 (SEA Production):** 2 active retainer clients in SEA/Taiwan
4. **Distribution:** 10 filmmakers on roster, 1+ distribution deal closed
5. **Events:** 3 events executed, 1+ paying sponsor
6. **Legal/Rights:** "AI Video Rights Playbook" v1.0 complete; legal expertise used as sales differentiator
7. **Pipeline:** 5+ warm leads for production, 3+ distribution channels in discussion
8. **Clarity:** Clear path to full-time transition in next 6-12 months

**The parallel strategy:**
- **MyVideo** provides credibility and distribution validation
- **SEA agencies** provide production revenue (Layer 1)
- **Both tracks reinforce each other** — MyVideo win accelerates SEA closes

**The core bet:** MyVideo closes in 60-90 days, which unlocks SEA agency conversations. SEA production revenue funds the distribution platform.

## Appendix: Legal & Rights Roadmap

**Why this matters:** SI8's tagline is "the trusted operator at the intersection of AI creators, rights, and commercial deployment." Legal/rights expertise is a core competency and competitive moat — not just an admin task.

| **1** | Contracts + Copyright basics | Signed contracts; initial legal landscape notes |
| **2** | Likeness/voice rights; APAC regulations | Updated playbook; 1 legal-focused LinkedIn post |
| **3** | Platform requirements; production rights checklist | Rights Checklist v1; Brand Safety Guidelines |
| **4** | Competitor analysis; systematize process | Refined checklist; documented legal issues |

- Who owns the output: prompter, tool company, or no one?
- How do different AI tools (Runway, Midjourney, Sora) handle IP?

**Training Data & Liability:**
- What lawsuits are pending against AI video tools?
- What liability exposure do users of these tools have?
- How to assess "clean" vs "risky" AI tools?

**Likeness & Voice:**
- When can AI-generated faces be used commercially?
- What are the rules for voice cloning?
- Celebrity likeness vs. synthetic faces?

**Platform Requirements:**
- What do streaming platforms require for AI content disclosure?
- What content restrictions exist (violence, adult, political)?
- How do ad platforms (Meta, Google) treat AI content?

**Brand Safety:**
- What makes AI content "brand-safe"?
- What disclosures do brands need?
- How to document provenance and rights chain?

### Legal as Sales Asset

**For Filmmakers:**
> "We've done the legal homework. We know which platforms accept AI content, what disclosures are required, and how to protect your rights."

**For Agencies:**
> "We handle the rights complexity so you don't have to. Every project comes with a rights clearance checklist and brand safety documentation."

**For Distribution:**
> "Our content comes with clear provenance, proper licensing, and platform-ready compliance."

**Potential Future Product:**
- "AI Video Rights Audit" — standalone consulting offering ($2-3K)
- "AI Video Rights Playbook" — packaged knowledge product (if market exists)
- "Rights-Cleared Creator Network" — pre-vetted filmmakers with clean processes
