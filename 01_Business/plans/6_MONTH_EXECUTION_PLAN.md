# SuperImmersive 8 — 6-Month Execution Plan

**Version:** 3.1
**Period:** February 2026 — July 2026
**Founder Context:** Part-time (10-15 hours/week), solo execution, based in Taipei
**Primary Goal:** Reach $5K/month stable revenue to enable full-time transition

---

## Strategic Framework

### The Four-Tier Model

| Tier | Offering | Who It's For | Price Signal |
|------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Tier 2 (Primary)** | Custom AI Product Placement — brand elements regenerated into existing catalog productions | Brands, agencies | Premium |
| **Tier 1 (Standard)** | Catalog licensing as-is | Platforms, airlines, streaming, editorial buyers | Standard |
| **Tier 3 (Advisory — inbound)** | Rights management + referral for brands building their own AI content pipeline | Brands doing own AI | Project fee |
| **Tier 4 (Commission — inbound)** | Full bespoke production | Existing relationships only — not advertised | High |

**Primary pitch (Year 1):** Tier 2 and Tier 1. Tier 3 and Tier 4 are inbound only — they come from relationships, not from outreach.

**The single Year 1 message:** "AI video content your legal team won't flag." — one message, tested consistently.

**Secondary pitch (discovery calls + proposals):** "We reduce time from creative brief to legal approval from 3 weeks to 3 days."

### Geographic Strategy: Parallel Tracks

**Track 1: MyVideo / Taiwan (Distribution Credibility)**
- **Why:** Warm lead with Jamie Lin (Chairman, Taiwan Mobile) — closeable in 60-90 days
- **Strategic value:** "We program AI shorts for Taiwan Mobile" opens every door
- **Language:** Traditional Mandarin (with Jamie Lin relationship, English may work)
- **Events:** All in-person events are Taipei-based
- **Goal:** Close pilot deal by Month 3 → use as credibility for everything else

**Track 2: SEA Agencies (Primary Revenue)**
- **Why:** Larger agency budgets, familiar with global AI tools, English as business language
- **Target cities:** Singapore (priority), Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Jakarta
- **Outreach:** Remote/digital (LinkedIn, email, video calls)
- **Goal:** 2 active licensing or placement clients by Month 6 → $5K+/month

**How the Tracks Reinforce Each Other:**
```
MyVideo Deal (Month 2-3)
        ↓
"We're on Taiwan Mobile's platform"
        ↓
SEA agencies take you seriously
        ↓
Catalog deals close faster
        ↓
Hire filmmakers for agency work
        ↓
Sign filmmakers for distribution
        ↓
More content for MyVideo
```

**Filmmaker Scouting: Global (English-Speaking)**
- **Why:** Best AI filmmakers are globally distributed, mostly English-speaking
- **Sources:** Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, Runway community, Curious Refuge alumni
- **Priority:** SEA-based filmmakers (can hire for agency work + sign for distribution)
- **Focus:** Quality and professionalism over geography

### Legal & Rights Infrastructure (Core Competency)

**Why this matters:**
SI8's positioning is "the trusted operator" who helps creators and brands navigate AI video **safely and legally**. This requires deep understanding of the evolving AI content legal landscape — not just contracts, but the underlying rights issues.

**The moat:** Most agencies and filmmakers are confused about AI rights. If SI8 becomes the expert who can answer "Is this legal? Is this brand-safe? What rights do we need?" — that's a defensible competitive advantage.

**Key areas to master:**

| Area | Why It Matters | Who Cares |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **AI Copyright (by jurisdiction)** | Can AI-generated content be copyrighted? Who owns it? | Filmmakers, platforms |
| **Training Data Rights** | Was the AI model trained legally? Liability exposure? | Agencies, brands |
| **Likeness & Voice Rights** | Using real people's faces/voices in AI content | Brands, agencies |
| **Platform Policies** | What do streaming platforms require/prohibit for AI content? | Distribution deals |
| **Disclosure Requirements** | When must content be labeled as AI-generated? | Brands, platforms |
| **Music & Audio Rights** | AI-generated music, sound effects, voice cloning | All productions |
| **Brand Safety** | What makes AI content "safe" for brand association? | Agencies, brands |
| **International Differences** | US vs EU vs regional regulations | Cross-border deals |

**Deliverable by Month 6:** "AI Video Rights Playbook" — internal document (potentially productizable) that covers:
- Current legal landscape summary
- Rights checklist for productions
- Platform-by-platform requirements
- Risk assessment framework
- Standard contract clauses

**This becomes a sales asset:**
> "We've done the legal homework so you don't have to. Here's our safe lane vetting process."

### Time Budget

**10-15 hours/week = 40-60 hours/month = 240-360 hours over 6 months**

| Activity | Hours/Week | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **Revenue outreach + calls** | 5 hrs | Non-negotiable. Below 5 hrs = miss $5K/month target. |
| **Delivery system + creator bench** | 3 hrs | Templates, QC, creator relationships |
| **Website + credibility assets** | 2 hrs | Iterate, don't perfect |
| **Event planning** | 2 hrs | Only if Month 3 event scheduled |
| **Rights playbook** | 1 hr | Iterate slowly — only what helps sell THIS month |

**Critical rule:** If you go below 5 hrs/week on outreach, you likely miss $5K/month by Month 6.

### The "No List" — Rights Verified Boundaries

*What SI8 will NOT do (prevents scope creep and risk):*

- No celebrity likeness (real people's faces without consent)
- No voice cloning of real people
- No explicit IP imitation (copyrighted characters, brands)
- No political persuasion content
- No deepfakes or deceptive content
- No adult/explicit content
- No projects without signed brief (clients must fill intake form)
- No projects without creator bench capacity (don't sell what you can't deliver)

### Geographic Focus (Refined)

**Month 1-2: Singapore ONLY**
- Trying Singapore + Manila + KL + Bangkok + Jakarta simultaneously = getting none
- Pick ONE city first, prove the model, then expand

**Month 3+: Expand to other SEA markets** (only after Singapore playbook is working)

### Revenue Targets (6-Month)

| Stream | Month 1-2 | Month 3-4 | Month 5-6 | 6-Month Total |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Tier 2: Product Placement | $0 | $0-15K (1 deal target) | $15-25K | $15-40K |
| Tier 1: Catalog Licensing | $0 | $2-5K | $3-8K | $5-13K |
| Event sponsorships | $0 | $2-5K | $2-5K | $4-10K |
| Tier 3: Advisory | $0 | $0 | $2-5K | $2-5K |
| **Total** | $0 | $4-25K | $22-43K | **$26-68K** |

**Exit criteria for Month 6:** On track for $5K/month stable run rate
**The upside case:** One Tier 2 placement deal ($20K+) in Month 4-5 changes the entire trajectory.

---

## Key Dependencies (Hidden Killers)

*These are the silent killers that break early-stage builds:*

| Dependency | Risk | Mitigation |
|------------|------|------------|
| **MyVideo ≠ deal execution** | Warm lead ≠ closed deal. Need: internal champion, legal review, programming needs, budget owner, timeline alignment | 60-90 days realistic, but don't let Track 1 stall Track 2 |
| **Need catalog before pitching Tier 2** | Can't sell product placement without content to place into | Sign 3-5 filmmakers with modification clause BEFORE brand outreach |
| **Event success = distribution list** | No list = weak attendance | List-building mechanism in Month 1, not just Month 2 |
| **Offers require credibility artifacts** | Buyers need: Rights Playbook, catalog samples, advisory board signal | Even mock/personal projects work — but you need them |

---

## What Will Break First

*These break first in 90% of services + brand businesses:*

**#1: Production scope creep**
- Client keeps "just one more tweak" → you lose 3 weeks → catalog development dies
- **Fix:** Enforce package constraints + revision limits strictly

**#2: Too many workstreams (context switching)**
- Start 6 initiatives, finish none
- **Fix:** Stable weekly operating cadence. Same activities, same days.

**#3: Event becomes a time sink**
- Logistics eats you alive
- **Fix:** Outsource event operations early. Venue + drinks + ticketing = contractor. You only own: speakers, content, conversion.

**#4: Overbuilding rights playbook**
- Disappear into writing instead of selling
- **Fix:** Only write what helps sell THIS month. v0.1 = 3 pages.

**#5: MyVideo stalls and blocks everything**
- Track 1 delay → Track 2 stalls → nothing happens
- **Fix:** Run parallel. Don't let Track 1 stall Track 2.

---

## Month 1: February 2026 — Foundation

**Theme:** "Build the catalog, sign the contracts, recruit advisors"
**Hours:** 40-50 hours

### First 30 Days — The 7 Things That Matter

*If you only nail these, the entire plan becomes viable:*

| # | Item | Deliverable |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Build catalog: sign 3-5 filmmakers** (with modification clause) | Minimum viable catalog before any Tier 2 pitch is made |
| 2 | **Launch website v1 in 7 days** | Catalog positioning, rights-agency framing, lead form, calendar link |
| 3 | **Produce Rights Playbook v0.1** | 3 pages max: Rights Verified, legal landscape, platform summary — the primary sales asset |
| 4 | **Lock filmmaker agreements** (modification clause is non-negotiable) | Signed shopping agreements with modification + exclusivity framework |
| 5 | **Recruit advisory board candidates** (3-5 people) | 1-page advisory memo drafted; first outreach sent |
| 6 | **Set up per-asset documentation SKU** | 9-field schema operational before first catalog entry is signed |
| 7 | **Build Singapore target list** | 100 agencies. Name, contact, niche, 1 reason why them. |

### Legal Infrastructure (CRITICAL)

**Note:** The modification clause in filmmaker agreements is the legal prerequisite for Tier 2 (product placement). Without it, the primary offering cannot be delivered.

**Contracts (with lawyer):**
- [ ] Find entertainment lawyer (Taiwan + US/international experience, AI-aware)
- [ ] Filmmaker Shopping Agreement with modification clause (authorizes SI8 to commission brand-integrated versions) + exclusivity framework (category-exclusive default for product placements)
- [ ] Draft Production Services Agreement (for agency clients)
- [ ] Draft basic Content Licensing Agreement template

**Legal Research (self-directed — iterate, don't perfect):**
- [ ] AI Copyright landscape: US Copyright Office guidance, recent cases
- [ ] Platform policies: Research YouTube, TikTok policies on AI content
- [ ] Create **Rights Playbook v0.1 (3 pages max)**:
  - Safe lane rules (what we will/won't do)
  - Key contract clauses
  - Platform policy summary

**Time:** 12-15 hours (contracts + research)
**Cost:** $2,000-4,000 (lawyer fees)
**Deliverables:**
- Usable contracts with modification clause
- Rights Playbook v0.1 (3 pages — NOT comprehensive, just what you need to sell)

**Note:** Don't disappear into writing. Only write what helps sell THIS month. Playbook grows iteratively:
- v0.1 (Month 1): 3 pages
- v0.2 (Month 2-3): 8 pages
- v1.0 (Month 6): Full playbook

### Catalog Building — CRITICAL Month 1 Priority

The Tier 2 product placement pitch requires a catalog. There is nothing to offer without content. Catalog building is therefore a prerequisite for revenue, not a parallel activity.

**Minimum viable catalog:** 3-5 works signed, safe lane vetted, and documented before the licensing path is pitched to any buyer.

**What each catalog entry requires:**
1. Signed non-exclusive shopping agreement (with modification clause)
2. Tool disclosure (which tools, which plans, at time of production)
3. Rights Verified sign-off (SI8 review against the No List)
4. Rights documentation (ownership confirmation, no third-party IP)
5. Per-asset documentation SKU (all 9 fields complete)

**Per-asset documentation SKU (9 fields — must be complete for every catalog entry):**
1. Tool provenance log (which AI tools, which version, which plan tier)
2. Model disclosure (Runway Gen-3, Kling v1.5, etc.)
3. Rights Verified sign-off (SI8 reviewer, date, notes)
4. Commercial use authorization (tool TOS confirmation, plan-level verification)
5. Modification rights status (is modification clause signed? scope?)
6. Category conflict log (any active exclusivity restrictions)
7. Territory log (geographic restrictions if any)
8. Regeneration rights status (can brand elements be regenerated into this work?)
9. Version history (dates, changes, re-review triggers)

**Modification clause requirement:** Every filmmaker shopping agreement must authorize SI8 to commission brand-integrated versions of catalog works. Without this clause, Tier 2 (product placement) cannot be offered. This is non-negotiable and must be in every agreement from day one.

**The Taipei filmmaker (post-Lunar New Year call):** First candidate for catalog. His existing award-winning work may qualify after safe lane review. Priority target.

**Time:** 8-10 hours
**Deliverable:** 3-5 filmmakers signed with compliant agreements + documentation SKU populated for each

### Advisory Board Recruitment — CRITICAL Month 1-2

The advisory board solves the "anchor case study" problem in Year 1. Before real deals exist, listed advisors signal credibility to buyers and filmmakers.

**Target advisor profiles:**
- An entertainment or IP lawyer (Taiwan or Singapore) — signals legal seriousness
- A brand marketing executive (agency or brand side) — buyer-side credibility
- An AI filmmaker or creative technologist — community credibility
- A streaming/platform executive — distribution credibility

**Terms:** Non-paying. In return: named on website, invited to speak at AI Creators Fest, first access to SI8 opportunities. Light time commitment (1-2 hours/quarter).

**Month 1 actions:**
- [ ] Identify 5-7 candidates from existing network
- [ ] Draft 1-page advisory memo (what SI8 is, why we're building an advisory board, what we're asking for)
- [ ] First outreach to top 3 candidates

**Why it matters:** An advisory board listed on the website gives first-contact buyers a reason to take the meeting before there is a case study to share. It answers "who vouches for you?"

**Time:** 3-4 hours
**Deliverable:** 3+ candidates identified, 1-page memo drafted, first outreach sent

### Website Launch (Ship in 7 days — not perfect)
- [ ] Catalog positioning + rights-agency framing
- [ ] Lead intake form (one link for everyone)
- [ ] Calendar link for booking calls
- [ ] "AI Rights safe lane" blurb (signals expertise)
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Deploy to Netlify/Vercel

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Cost:** $0-50
**Rule:** Ship in 7 days. Iterate later. Perfectionism kills momentum.

### Credibility Assets (Before outreach begins)
- [ ] Rights Playbook v0.1 (primary sales asset — 3 pages, safe lane framing)
- [ ] 10-slide deck OR 1-page PDF (buyer-facing)
- [ ] 2-3 sample AI video outputs from catalog (safe lane vetted)
- [ ] Case study template ready (Problem → Approach → Output → Lessons)

**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Why:** Buyers need credibility artifacts. The Rights Playbook differentiates SI8 from every AI video vendor who sends a reel.

### Sales Ops Setup (This makes or breaks Month 2-6)
- [ ] Lead intake + qualification form (company, role, budget range, use case, timeline)
- [ ] CRM + pipeline stages (6 max): Prospect → Contacted → Meeting Booked → Proposal Sent → Negotiation → Won/Lost
- [ ] Proposal template (1-page + SOW) — must take <45 min per proposal
- [ ] Pricing guardrails: "if X then quote Y" (e.g., "Tier 2 placement + rights package = $15-25K baseline")

**Time:** 3-4 hours

### Delivery Ops Setup (Before you sell aggressively)
- [ ] Catalog Brief Template (objective, audience, tone, safe lane constraints, do-not-do list)
- [ ] Creative QA Checklist (branding, safe lane, motion stability, audio, specs)
- [ ] Revision policy: "2 rounds max", "only 1 consolidated revision doc"
- [ ] Asset folder structure: /Client/Project/01_briefs, /02_versions, /03_deliverables_final
- [ ] Identify 2-3 potential creators for bench (relationships, not contracts yet)

**Time:** 4-5 hours
**Why:** Scope creep is the #1 failure mode. Lock this BEFORE scaling outreach.

### Singapore Agency Research (Primary)
- [ ] Build target list: **100 Singapore agencies** (ONE market, go deep)
- [ ] Focus: Digital agencies, content agencies, performance marketing agencies
- [ ] For each: name, founder/partner, email, LinkedIn, niche, 1 reason why them
- [ ] Research via LinkedIn, agency directories, industry publications
- [ ] Identify decision makers (Creative Directors, Heads of Production, MDs)

**Time:** 8-10 hours
**Deliverable:** 100-agency Singapore target list

**Why Singapore only:** Trying Singapore + Manila + KL + Bangkok + Jakarta = getting none. Pick ONE city, prove the model, then expand in Month 3+.

### Taiwan Agency Research (Secondary)
- [ ] Build target list: 15 Taiwan agencies
- [ ] Focus: Agencies serving international brands, tech-forward agencies
- [ ] Leverage existing network where possible

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Deliverable:** 15-agency target list

### Filmmaker Research (Catalog Recruitment)
- [ ] Build target list: 30 AI filmmakers to potentially sign
- [ ] Criteria: Quality work, 5K+ followers, active, professional, English-speaking
- [ ] Sources: Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, Runway community
- [ ] Categorize: Tier 1 (reach first), Tier 2, Tier 3
- [ ] Note: Geographic distribution (SEA filmmakers = bonus for agency work)

**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Deliverable:** 30-filmmaker target list

### MyVideo / Taiwan Mobile (PRIORITY — Track 1)
- [ ] Draft proposal for Jamie Lin: Curated AI shorts pilot program
  - Concept: 5-10 AI shorts, 30-minute programming block
  - Ask: Pilot commitment for Q2/Q3 2026
  - Positioning: "First AI film program on a major Taiwan streaming platform"
- [ ] Research MyVideo's current content strategy and gaps
- [ ] Prepare supporting materials (filmmaker reel, content samples from catalog)
- [ ] Send proposal by end of Month 1

**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Deliverable:** MyVideo proposal sent to Jamie Lin
**Why this matters:** A "yes" from MyVideo changes every conversation that follows.

### Other Distribution Channels
- [ ] SEA streaming research: Viu, iQIYI, regional OTT platforms
- [ ] FAST channels: Samsung TV Plus, LG Channels (streaming platforms)
- [ ] Educational: SEA universities, Taiwan universities, corporate training

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Deliverable:** Channel target list for future outreach

### Month 1 Checkpoint

**Must have by end of Month 1:**
- [ ] 3-5 filmmakers signed (shopping agreements with modification clause)
- [ ] Per-asset documentation SKU populated for each catalog entry
- [ ] Advisory board outreach sent (3+ candidates)
- [ ] Website live
- [ ] Rights Playbook v0.1 complete (3 pages)
- [ ] MyVideo proposal sent to Jamie Lin
- [ ] 30+ Singapore agency targets identified

**Go/No-Go:** If fewer than 3 filmmakers are signed by end of Month 1, delay brand outreach — there is nothing to show. Catalog first.

**Parallel Tracks Status:**
- Track 1 (MyVideo): Proposal sent, awaiting response
- Track 2 (Singapore agencies): Target list ready, outreach begins Month 2
- Catalog: 3-5 works signed (prerequisite for Month 2 pitch)

---

## Month 2: March 2026 — First Outreach

**Theme:** "First outreach with the new pitch — catalog + placement"
**Hours:** 45-55 hours

### Singapore Agency Outreach (PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Outreach cadence: 10/day, 5 days/week = 50/week = 200/month**
- [ ] Method: LinkedIn + email, personalized to their work/clients
- [ ] Pitch: "AI content your legal team won't flag — license from our vetted catalog, or place your brand directly into a production. No reshoot."
- [ ] **Follow-up sequence: 7 touchpoints over 21 days** (prewritten/templated)
- [ ] Track: Response rates, objections, interest level
- [ ] Book calls in Week 3-4
- [ ] **Qualifying question:** "Has your legal team flagged AI-generated content as a risk?" If yes → SI8 is the solution conversation. If no → education opportunity.
- [ ] **Credibility asset:** Send Rights Playbook v0.1 after first response. This differentiates SI8 from every other AI video vendor who sends a reel.

**Outreach assets (created in Month 1):**
- [x] LinkedIn connection message template
- [x] Follow-up email sequence (7 touches)
- [x] One-pager PDF
- [x] Rights Playbook v0.1

**Time:** 12-15 hours
**Goal:** 5+ discovery calls scheduled; >10% response rate

### Taiwan Agency Outreach (Secondary)
- [ ] Reach out to 10-15 Taiwan agencies
- [ ] Leverage warm intros from network where possible
- [ ] Bilingual pitch (English + Mandarin as appropriate)
- [ ] Lower priority than Singapore — only if time permits

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Goal:** 2-3 conversations

### Event List Building (CRITICAL — Start NOW)
- [ ] Begin building attendee list for Month 3 event
- [ ] Pre-sell "industry seats" even before final lineup confirmed
- [ ] Target: 20+ committed attendees before Month 3
- [ ] Make seats feel scarce ("limited to 25 industry executives")

**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Why:** Event success depends on distribution list. No list = weak attendance. Start in Month 2, not Month 3.

### Filmmaker Outreach (Catalog Recruitment)
- [ ] Reach out to 15-20 Tier 1 filmmakers
- [ ] Pitch: "Building a safe lane vetted AI film catalog — interested in representation and product placement revenue?"
- [ ] Lead with: Distribution relationships (MyVideo, platforms) + Tier 2 placement upside
- [ ] Note: SEA-based filmmakers = priority (can also hire for agency work)

**Time:** 8-10 hours
**Goal:** 5+ conversations, 1-2 soft commits

### MyVideo Follow-Up (PRIORITY — Track 1)
- [ ] Follow up with Jamie Lin on proposal
- [ ] If positive: Get LOI or written commitment for pilot
- [ ] If needs more: Offer to present in person, bring content samples
- [ ] If meeting scheduled: Prepare pitch deck, filmmaker showcase
- [ ] Identify internal champion (content head, programming director)

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Goal:** LOI or clear commitment by end of Month 2
**Why this matters:** MyVideo "yes" = instant credibility for SEA agency conversations

### Product Placement Workflow — Research and Proof of Concept

Before pitching Tier 2 at premium prices, the workflow must be understood and documented.

**Month 2 research tasks:**
- [ ] How does regenerating brand elements into an existing AI production actually work technically? (Runway inpainting? ControlNet? Model fine-tuning?)
- [ ] What catalog characteristics make a production "eligible" for brand placement vs. not?
- [ ] What does a placement brief look like? What information does SI8 need from the brand?
- [ ] What does delivery look like? (Multiple cutdowns? Territory variations?)
- [ ] Build a simple one-page "Product Placement Process" document for use in proposals

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Deliverable:** One-page product placement process document; workflow understood before pitching

### Event Planning — First B2B Event
- [ ] Set date for first event (target: mid-April)
- [ ] Format decision: B2B dinner/roundtable (15-25 people) vs. hybrid showcase
- [ ] Venue research: Hotels, co-working spaces, private dining in Taipei
- [ ] Theme: "AI Video for Brands: What Agencies Need to Know in 2026"
- [ ] Invite list: Mix of SEA + Taiwan agency contacts, plus local creatives
- [ ] Consider: Can MyVideo/Taiwan Mobile content head be a speaker?

**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Goal:** Date, venue, and format confirmed

### Legal Research (Ongoing)
- [ ] Research likeness/voice rights: What are the rules for AI-generated faces/voices?
- [ ] Interview 1-2 filmmakers: What legal concerns do they have?
- [ ] Research region-specific regulations: Taiwan, Singapore, any emerging rules?
- [ ] Update "AI Video Rights Playbook" with findings
- [ ] Identify 2-3 legal edge cases to discuss with lawyer

**Time:** 2-3 hours

### Content & Brand Building
- [ ] LinkedIn content: 2-3 posts/week about AI video for brands
- [ ] Document learnings from outreach (for future content)
- [ ] **Consider:** 1 LinkedIn post on AI video legal landscape (positions you as expert)

**Time:** 4-6 hours

### Month 2 Checkpoint

**Parallel Tracks Status:**

| Track | Metric | Target | Actual |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Track 1: MyVideo** | Status | LOI or clear signal | |
| Track 2: SEA Agencies | Outreach sent | 15-20 | |
| Track 2: SEA Agencies | Response rate | >10% | |
| Track 2: SEA Agencies | Discovery calls | 5+ | |
| Catalog: Filmmakers | Conversations | 5+ | |

**Scenario planning:**
- **MyVideo YES + SEA traction:** Full speed ahead, use MyVideo in all SEA pitches
- **MyVideo YES + SEA slow:** Lead with MyVideo credibility, adjust SEA messaging
- **MyVideo slow + SEA traction:** Focus on SEA, keep MyVideo warm
- **Both slow:** Reassess targeting and messaging

**Warning signs:**
- <10% response rate from SEA agencies = messaging problem
- Zero discovery calls = targeting or offer problem
- MyVideo going dark = need to re-engage through different channel

---

## Month 3: April 2026 — First Event + First Deals

**Theme:** "Run the event, close first catalog deal, build first placement proof-of-concept"
**Hours:** 50-60 hours (event-intensive month)

### First B2B Event (KEY MILESTONE)
- [ ] Execute first event (target: 20-30 attendees)
- [ ] Attendee mix: 50% agency/brand execs, 50% AI creators/enthusiasts
- [ ] Format: Keynote/panel + AI film showcase + networking
- [ ] Your role: Host, moderator, primary expert
- [ ] Capture: Photos, testimonials, contact info
- [ ] Post-event: Follow-up emails, meeting requests

**Event goals:**
- 20+ attendees
- 3-5 follow-up meetings with agency execs
- Content for social proof
- 1+ potential sponsor conversation

**Time:** 20-25 hours (including prep)
**Cost:** $1,000-2,000 (venue, F&B, AV)

### First Catalog Deal + Placement Proof-of-Concept (PRIORITY)

**Catalog licensing (Tier 1):**
- [ ] Convert discovery calls to proposals
- [ ] Target: Close 1 catalog licensing deal (even small — $2-5K validates the model)
- [ ] Pricing: Per-deal licensing based on scope, territory, and use case
- [ ] This is validation that the catalog model works before pitching Tier 2

**Product placement proof-of-concept (Tier 2):**
- [ ] Identify 1 willing brand/agency partner for a proof-of-concept placement
- [ ] Even if at-cost or reduced price — you need 1 example before pitching it at $20K
- [ ] Document the process: brief → selection → regeneration → delivery
- [ ] This becomes the case study that makes every future Tier 2 pitch credible

**Time:** 10-12 hours
**Goal:** 1 catalog licensing deal closed OR 2+ proposals out; 1 placement POC initiated

**The MyVideo multiplier:** If MyVideo pilot is confirmed by Month 3, your SEA pitch becomes:
> "We're the team behind Taiwan Mobile's AI shorts program. We help agencies find and license AI video content — vetted and safe lane compliant."

That's a different conversation than cold outreach.

### Filmmaker Signing (Catalog Growth)
- [ ] Convert conversations to signed Shopping Agreements
- [ ] Target: 5-8 filmmakers signed by end of month (up from 3-5 in Month 1)
- [ ] Priority: Filmmakers who can also do agency work (dual value)
- [ ] Onboard: Populate documentation SKU for each new catalog entry

**Time:** 6-8 hours
**Goal:** 5+ filmmakers signed; catalog fully documented

### Distribution Channel Progress
- [ ] MyVideo: Push for decision or pilot commitment
- [ ] Educational: Pitch 3-5 SEA/Taiwan universities
- [ ] Festivals: Submit represented work to 2-3 AI festivals

**Time:** 4-6 hours
**Goal:** 1 channel moving toward commitment

### Legal & Rights Development
- [ ] Document legal questions from filmmaker/agency conversations
- [ ] Research platform requirements: What does MyVideo require for AI content?
- [ ] Create "Rights Checklist" for catalog projects (1-pager)
- [ ] Draft "Brand Safety Guidelines" for buyer clients
- [ ] Update "AI Video Rights Playbook"

**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Deliverable:** Rights Checklist v1 for catalog projects

### Month 3 Checkpoint

**Validation scorecard:**

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Event attendance | 20+ | |
| Follow-up meetings from event | 3+ | |
| Catalog licensing deals closed | 1 | |
| Proposals out | 2+ | |
| Filmmakers signed | 5+ | |
| Distribution channels in discussion | 2+ | |
| Placement POC initiated | 1 | |

**Decision point:** If zero licensing interest after 20+ agency conversations, reassess messaging and catalog composition.

---

## Month 4: May 2026 — Revenue Ramp

**Theme:** "First Tier 2 placement deal, second event"
**Hours:** 50-60 hours

### Tier 2: First Product Placement Deal (PRIMARY TARGET)

- [ ] Use placement POC from Month 3 as proof point: "Here's what we did for [Brand X]"
- [ ] Target: 1 signed Tier 2 product placement deal ($15-25K)
- [ ] Category-exclusive default — position this as premium from the start
- [ ] Pricing signal: "Placement + rights package" — not just production
- [ ] Continue catalog licensing (Tier 1) in parallel as volume driver

**Time:** 15-20 hours
**Goal:** $15-25K from Tier 2; $2-5K from Tier 1 catalog licensing

### Second B2B Event
- [ ] Second event (target: 30-40 attendees)
- [ ] Iterate based on first event feedback
- [ ] More aggressive sponsor outreach (target: 1 paying sponsor)
- [ ] Content: Feature case study from first placement proof-of-concept

  - Consider: Raise prices? Different buyer segment?

**Scenario C: <$2K/month run rate**
- **Action:** Pivot or pause
  - What specifically isn't working?
  - Is it targeting, pricing, product, or market timing?
  - Options: Pivot to pure advisory, pause and wait for market, exit

**Scenario D: Catalog working, placement not**
- **Action:** Focus on Tier 1 as the primary revenue stream
  - Accept that Tier 2 is a longer-term play
  - Build catalog licensing into sustainable volume model

## Appendix: Legal & Rights Roadmap

**Why this matters:** SI8's tagline is "the trusted operator at the intersection of AI creators, rights, and commercial deployment." Legal/rights expertise is a core competency and competitive moat — not just an admin task.

### 6-Month Legal Research Roadmap

| Month | Focus Area | Deliverable |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **1** | Contracts + Copyright basics + modification clause + exclusivity framework for filmmaker agreements | Signed contracts with modification clause; initial legal landscape notes |
| **2** | Likeness/voice rights; regional regulations (Taiwan, Singapore) | Updated playbook; 1 legal-focused LinkedIn post |
| **3** | Platform requirements; catalog rights checklist | Rights Checklist v1; Brand Safety Guidelines |
| **4** | Competitor analysis; systematize process | Refined checklist; documented legal issues |
| **5** | Productize legal knowledge | Client-facing Rights Assessment; advisory offering |
| **6** | Finalize and assess | AI Video Rights Playbook v1.0 |

### Key Legal Questions to Answer

**Copyright & Ownership:**
- Can AI-generated content be copyrighted in US? Taiwan? Singapore?
- Who owns the output: prompter, tool company, or no one?
- How do different AI tools (Runway, Midjourney, Sora) handle IP?

**Training Data & Liability:**
- What lawsuits are pending against AI video tools?
- What liability exposure do users of these tools have?
- How to assess "clean" vs "risky" AI tools?

**Likeness & Voice:**
- When can AI-generated faces be used commercially?
- What are the rules for voice cloning?
- Celebrity likeness vs. synthetic faces?

**Platform Requirements:**
- What do streaming platforms require for AI content disclosure?
- What content restrictions exist (violence, adult, political)?
- How do ad platforms (Meta, Google) treat AI content?

**Brand Safety:**
- What makes AI content "brand-safe"?
- What disclosures do brands need?
- How to document provenance and rights chain?

### Legal as Sales Asset

**For Filmmakers:**
> "We've done the legal homework. We know which platforms accept AI content, what disclosures are required, and how to protect your rights."

**For Agencies:**
> "We handle the rights complexity so you don't have to. Every catalog entry comes with a safe lane sign-off and brand safety documentation."

**For Distribution:**
> "Our content comes with clear provenance, proper licensing, and platform-ready compliance."

**Potential Future Product:**
- "AI Video Rights Audit" — standalone advisory offering ($2-3K)
- "AI Video Rights Playbook" — packaged knowledge product (if market exists)
- "Rights Verified Vetted Catalog" — pre-vetted filmmakers with clean, documented processes
