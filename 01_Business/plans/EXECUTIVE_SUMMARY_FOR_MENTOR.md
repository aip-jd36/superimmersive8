# SuperImmersive 8 — Executive Summary

*Prepared: January 2026*
*For: Mentor Review*

---

## The Opportunity

AI-generated video has crossed a quality threshold. Tools like Runway, Sora, Kling, and Veo now enable creators to produce professional-quality short films at a fraction of traditional costs. A new wave of "AI filmmakers" is emerging — but they lack pathways to monetization, distribution, and professional representation.

Meanwhile, brands and agencies are asking: *"How do we use AI video without getting sued or looking cheap?"*

**SuperImmersive 8 (SI8)** sits at this intersection — helping AI filmmakers get distributed AND helping enterprises navigate AI video production.

---

## The Business

**What we do:**
- Represent AI filmmakers and license their work to streaming platforms, brands, festivals, and educational institutions
- Advise agencies and brands on AI video strategy, talent sourcing, and production oversight
- Host B2B events that position SI8 as the go-to expert on AI video in Asia-Pacific

**Business model:**
- Consulting retainers and project fees (primary revenue)
- Distribution commissions (25% of deals brokered)
- Event sponsorships

**Regional focus:** APAC + Europe first, US later
- Avoids head-on competition with well-funded US players (Escape.ai, Curious Refuge)
- Leverages founder's Taipei base and existing relationships
- Taiwan Mobile Chairman (Jamie Lin) has expressed interest in programming AI shorts on MyVideo

## The Strategic Pivot

### Original Thesis (Validated but Insufficient)
Curate AI shorts → License to streaming platforms → Take commission

**The problem:** The revenue math doesn't work for a solo founder.
- AI shorts license for $2-5K each
- 25% commission = $500-1,250 per deal
- Year 1 projection: ~$10-12K in commissions
- That's a side hustle, not a job.

### Revised Thesis (Events-First → Consulting)
Host B2B executive events → Convert attendees to consulting clients → Use distribution for credibility

**Why this works:**
- Consulting deals are $5-15K per project or $2-3K/month retainers
- One event generating 2 clients = $40-70K annual value
- Founder has 10+ years B2B enterprise sales experience
- Founder has proven track record: events → consulting conversions

**The identity shift:**
- FROM: "AI film distributor" (low-margin middleman)
- TO: "AI video advisor for enterprises" (high-value expert)

## Revenue Model (Year 1 Target: $80-120K)

| Revenue Stream | Target | How |
|----------------|--------|-----|
| Consulting retainers | $50-72K | 2-3 agency clients × $2-3K/month |
| Project consulting | $15-30K | 2-3 projects × $5-10K each |
| Event sponsorships | $10-20K | AI tool companies, production houses |
| Distribution commissions | $5-10K | MyVideo + other channels |
| **Total** | **$80-132K** | |

**Path to quitting day job:** If 3 B2B events convert to 4-5 consulting clients by end of Year 1, the revenue supports full-time transition.

---

## The 6-Month Plan (Feb - Jul 2026)

### Month 1-2: Foundation
- Sign 5-8 AI filmmakers to non-exclusive representation (Shopping Agreements)
- Build "AI Video for Enterprise" presentation deck
- Identify 30 target agency/brand executives in Taipei
- Continue MyVideo conversations (use as credibility, not gating requirement)

### Month 3: First Event
- Host intimate B2B dinner/roundtable (15-20 agency execs)
- Theme: "How Top Brands Are Using AI Video Without Getting Sued"
- Founder role: Host, primary speaker, expert
- Goal: Book 3-5 follow-up meetings at the event

### Month 4: First Consulting Clients
- Convert event leads to paying clients
- Target: 1-2 retainers ($2-3K/month) or projects ($5-10K)
- Deliver value, build case studies

### Month 5: Second Event + Scale
- Host second B2B event (refined based on learnings)
- Expand consulting pipeline
- Begin MyVideo pilot delivery (if deal closes)

### Month 6: Assessment
- Revenue check: On track for $80K+ annual run rate?
- Client satisfaction: Are retainer clients renewing?
- Decision: Accelerate, maintain, or pivot

## Key Assets

1. **Warm lead:** Jamie Lin (Chairman, Taiwan Mobile) expressed interest in AI shorts programming for MyVideo
2. **Founder background:** 10+ years B2B enterprise sales, proven events → consulting conversion
3. **Regional positioning:** No serious AI film competitor in APAC
4. **Network:** Family in LA/Taipei post-production; existing relationships in film + tech

---

## Key Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Consulting market too small in Taipei | Expand to regional agencies, international brands with APAC presence |
| Events don't convert | First event is the test; pivot if <2 clients from first 2 events |
| MyVideo deal falls through | MyVideo is credibility accelerant, not requirement; events work without it |
| Legal uncertainty around AI content | Position as the "safe" advisor who helps brands navigate risk |

---

## What Success Looks Like

**End of Year 1:**
- 3-5 consulting clients (mix of retainers and projects)
- $80-120K revenue (enough to consider full-time transition)
- 3 successful B2B events executed
- 5-10 AI filmmakers on roster with content placed
- Recognized as the AI video expert in Taiwan/APAC

**The core insight:** This is not an "AI film distribution company." It's a **high-trust advisory practice with AI video as the wedge.** Distribution creates credibility. Events create pipeline. Consulting creates revenue.

## Questions for Mentor

1. Does this path make sense given the founder's B2B sales background?
2. What's the realistic timeline to quit day job — end of Year 1 or Year 2?
3. Who should be invited to the first B2B event? Any introductions?
4. Is the Taipei agency market big enough, or should the events target regional/international clients?
5. Any blind spots in this strategy?

---

*Summary: AI video expertise monetized through B2B consulting, with distribution and events as credibility and pipeline engines. Target: $80-120K Year 1, full-time transition by end of year.*
