# SuperImmersive 8
## Business Plan v2.0 — Demand-Side First

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** February 2026
**Supersedes:** BUSINESS_PLAN_v1.md (January 2026)
**Change summary:** Year 1 pitch reframed demand-side first. Core structure unchanged.

> For sections unchanged from v1 (legal framework, competitive landscape, market data, financial projections, risk analysis), refer to BUSINESS_PLAN_v1.md. This document focuses on what changed and why.

## What Changed and Why

**v1 positioning (supply-side first):**
> "We represent AI filmmakers and license their work to buyers."

**v2 positioning (demand-side first):**
> "Brands and agencies can license safe lane AI content from our vetted catalog, or commission new work through our vetted filmmaker network. Either way, you won't be exposed."

**Why the shift:**
- Brands and agencies have budget in Year 1. Filmmakers don't pay SI8 — buyers do.
- 2025-2026 is peak legal fear around AI content. That fear is the door opener.
- The Rights Playbook (now built) is more powerful as a marketing asset to buyers than as internal infrastructure.
- Distribution commissions alone ($750-1,250 per deal) can't reach $5K/month in Year 1 — production and consulting with brands can.
- The long-term supply-side moat (filmmaker roster, catalog, distribution platform) is unchanged — it's just not the Year 1 pitch.

---

## Executive Summary (v2)

SuperImmersive 8 (SI8) is an AI film distribution agency based in Taipei, Taiwan. We operate at the intersection of AI creators, rights, and commercial deployment — the three things brands and agencies need to navigate confidently in 2026.

**The buyer problem SI8 solves:**
Brands and agencies want to use AI-generated video content. They can't. Not because the technology isn't ready — it is. Because the legal exposure is real and the market is full of unvetted content from unvetted creators. AI content has been used that infringes copyrights. Campaigns have been pulled. Legal teams are saying no.

**The SI8 solution — two paths, one guarantee:**

| Path | What | Who it's for |
|------|------|--------------|
| **License** | Safe lane AI films and commercials from our vetted catalog | Brands/agencies needing immediate content |
| **Commission** | New AI content produced through our vetted filmmaker network | Brands/agencies needing custom work |

Both paths come with the same guarantee: every piece of content has been through SI8's rights vetting process. We have done the legal homework so you don't have to.

**The long-term play:**
Year 1 is demand-side — we build revenue by solving the buyer's problem. Years 2-3 are supply-side — filmmaker representation, a growing catalog, and distribution commissions become the scalable platform. Production funds distribution. Demand-side builds the supply-side moat.

**Tagline:** *"The trusted operator at the intersection of AI creators, rights, and commercial deployment."*

## The Two-Layer Model (v2 — Same Structure, Clearer Sequencing)

The two-layer model from v1 is unchanged. What's clearer in v2 is the sequencing — which layer leads in which year.

```
YEAR 1 — DEMAND SIDE LEADS
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Outreach pitch:    "Rights-cleared AI content for brands/agencies"
Revenue driver:    Layer 1 production + consulting from events
Public brand:      Buyer-facing ("license or commission — both rights-cleared")
Events:            Lead with brand/agency content; filmmakers showcased as vetted talent
Rights Playbook:   Marketing asset to buyers (proof of claim)

YEAR 2-3 — SUPPLY SIDE SCALES
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Outreach pitch:    "We represent the best AI filmmakers in APAC"
Revenue driver:    Distribution commissions + catalog licensing
Public brand:      Both-facing (filmmakers and buyers served equally)
Events:            Established community; roster is the anchor
Rights Playbook:   Industry standard; SI8 is the reference point
```

**Layer 1 — Production Services (Demand-Side, Year 1 Revenue)**

Unchanged from v1. The v2 addition: Layer 1 is now explicitly demand-side-first in its pitch. The outreach to Singapore agencies no longer leads with "we do AI video production" — it leads with "we do rights-cleared AI video production for agencies." The Rights Playbook is the first document sent after initial contact.

**Layer 2 — Distribution + Events (Supply-Side, Year 1 Foundation / Year 2-3 Revenue)**

Unchanged from v1. The v2 clarification: the public brand in Year 1 is buyer-facing. The filmmaker representation value prop (Kobalt-style, creator-first) becomes the primary public brand from Year 2 once the catalog has content and the rights expertise has been proven in market.

---

## Core Value Proposition (v2)

### For Brands and Agencies (Primary Year 1 Pitch)

> *"AI video is ready. The legal landscape isn't — yet. SI8 is the agency that bridges the gap. Every filmmaker in our network works within our documented safe lane. Every piece of content in our catalog has been through our safe lane process. You get the creative power of AI film without the legal exposure."*

**Two concrete paths:**
1. **License from the catalog** — existing AI films and commercials, rights cleared, ready to use
2. **Commission through the network** — brief SI8, we match you with a vetted filmmaker, work produced within the safe lane

**What brands get:**
- Rights documentation for every piece of content
- Filmmaker tool disclosure (which AI tools were used and their license status)
- SI8's safe lane guarantee (no real-person likeness, no voice cloning, no IP imitation)
- Proactive AI disclosure handling (YouTube, TikTok compliance built in)

### Risk Tiers (v2 Addition — Offered from Day One)

SI8 offers two tiers to match buyer risk tolerance. Both tiers require full safe lane compliance and documentation.

| Tier | Tools Required | Best For | Price Signal |
|------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| **Certified Tier** | Adobe Firefly only (licensed training data, no litigation) | Fortune 500 brands, legal-heavy clients, financial services | Premium |
| **Standard Tier** | Runway, Pika, Sora (paid plans, documented) | Startups, agencies, content-forward clients | Standard |

**Why tiers, not just tiers:**
- Some legal teams will only approve tools with fully licensed training data — Adobe Firefly is the only tier-1 tool that meets this bar today
- Most buyers are fine with Runway/Pika with proper documentation
- The tier is about the buyer's legal team, not the quality of the output
- SI8's safe lane process applies equally to both tiers — the difference is tool selection and what SI8 can defensibly represent about training data provenance

**What SI8 never offers:** A "wild tier" — no Hailuo, no Midjourney, no tools in active studio litigation, regardless of price.

---

### For AI Filmmakers (Year 1 Supporting Pitch / Year 2 Primary Pitch)

Unchanged from v1. Non-exclusive representation, 75% of all deals brokered, distribution to APAC + Europe channels, legal infrastructure SI8 has built. The filmmaker pitch in Year 1 is secondary to buyer outreach — but it's how the catalog gets built.

---

## Year 1 Go-to-Market (v2)

### Primary Motion: Brand/Agency Outreach (Singapore First)

**The opening pitch (cold outreach):**
> *"[Agency name] — I noticed you're producing video content for [client/sector]. AI-generated video is getting traction in the region, but most agencies are rightly cautious about the legal exposure. We're SI8 — we've built the rights infrastructure that makes AI video safe for agency use. Two paths: license existing vetted content, or commission new work through our filmmaker network. Worth 20 minutes?"*

**The follow-up asset:** Rights Playbook v0.1 — sent after first response. This is what makes SI8 different from every other AI video vendor who sends a reel.

**The qualifying question:** "Has your legal team flagged AI-generated content as a risk?" If yes — SI8 is the solution conversation. If no — education opportunity.

### Advisory Board (Year 1 Action — New in v2)

SI8 will recruit 3-5 advisors to list publicly on the website. This solves the "anchor case study" problem in Year 1 — before real deals exist, advisors signal credibility to buyers and filmmakers.

**Target advisor profiles:**
- An entertainment or IP lawyer (Taiwan or Singapore) — signals legal seriousness
- A brand marketing executive (APAC agency or brand) — buyer-side credibility
- An AI filmmaker or creative technologist — community credibility
- A streaming/platform executive — distribution credibility

**Terms:** Non-paying. In return: named on website, invited to speak at AI Creators Fest, first access to SI8 opportunities. Light time commitment.

**Why it matters:** An advisory board listed on the website gives first-contact buyers a reason to take the meeting before there is a case study to share. It answers "who vouches for you?"

**Month 1-2 action:** Identify candidates, reach out with a 1-page advisory memo. Prioritize anyone already in the network.

---

### Secondary Motion: MyVideo / Taiwan (Credibility Track)

Unchanged from v1. MyVideo proposal positions SI8 as the curator of rights-cleared AI content for the platform. The rights vetting angle is equally relevant here: "Every film in our program has been through our safe lane process."

### Geographic Strategy: Two Test Markets in Parallel (v2 Update)

v1 said "Singapore ONLY for Month 1-2." v2 runs two markets in parallel — different audiences, different languages, same pitch.

| Market | Language | Primary Audience | Anchor Lead |
|--------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Taipei / Taiwan** | Mandarin (Traditional) | MyVideo / Taiwan Mobile; local agencies; Mandarin-speaking filmmakers | Jamie Lin (Taiwan Mobile) |
| **Singapore** | English | SEA agencies; English-speaking brands; international buyers | Cold outreach, warm network |

**Why both, not one:**
- Taipei is the base — warm relationships, MyVideo lead, local filmmaker (post-Lunar New Year call)
- Singapore is the revenue engine — English, international agencies, APAC buyer hub
- They don't compete for the same attention: Taipei is Mandarin-facing, Singapore is English-facing
- Learnings from one market apply to the other

**Website implication:** The website requires a language selector — English and Traditional Chinese (繁體中文). Same content, two languages. Mandarin version needed before any serious Taipei B2B outreach.

---

### Tertiary Motion: Filmmaker Acquisition (Catalog Building)

Outreach to 30 AI filmmakers globally (per v1 plan) continues in parallel. The pitch to filmmakers in Year 1 is: "We have buyer relationships and a rights infrastructure. Join the network, work within our safe lane, and we'll connect your work to APAC buyers." Not the full Kobalt-style representation pitch yet — that comes in Year 2 when there are real deals to point to.

**Catalog building is a Month 1-2 priority (v2 addition):** The "license from our catalog" pitch path requires a catalog. A minimum of 3-5 works must be signed and safe lane vetted before the licensing path is credibly offered to buyers. Every catalog entry requires:
1. Signed non-exclusive representation agreement
2. Tool disclosure (which tools, which plans, at time of production)
3. Safe lane sign-off (SI8 review against the No List)
4. Rights documentation package (ownership confirmation, no third-party IP)

The Taipei filmmaker (post-Lunar New Year call) is a candidate for the first catalog entry — his existing award-winning work may qualify after safe lane review.

---

### Open Item: E&O Insurance

Errors & Omissions (E&O) insurance for AI-generated content has been flagged as a critical gap by external reviewers. SI8 does not currently have E&O coverage, and it is unclear whether E&O policies covering AI-generated content are available at small agency scale in 2026.

**Status:** Future investigation. Not a Year 1 blocker, but should be resolved before significant production volume. Questions to answer:
- Is E&O for AI content available from standard media liability insurers?
- What does coverage cost at small agency scale?
- Does absence of E&O create meaningful sales friction with large-brand buyers?

---

## AI Creator Fest — Event Strategy (v2)

### Core Reframe

v1: AI Creator Fest is a filmmaker community event with agency guests.
v2: AI Creator Fest is an industry briefing for brands/agencies, with AI filmmakers as the featured talent.

Same room. Same people. Completely different framing — and completely different conversion rate.

### Event Structure (v2)

**Format:** Half-day B2B event, 20-40 attendees (Month 3 target)
**Audience:** 50-60% agency/brand execs, 40-50% AI creators
**SI8's role:** Host, moderator, expert — the reason everyone is in the room

| Section | Content | Conversion Goal |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Opening** | "The state of AI content rights in 2026 — what brands need to know" | Agency execs understand the problem SI8 solves |
| **Filmmaker Showcase** | 4-5 vetted SI8 roster films, brief filmmaker Q&A | Agencies see vetted talent; filmmakers feel represented |
| **Panel** | "How brands are using AI film safely — case studies" | Agencies identify as potential production clients |
| **Networking** | SI8 as matchmaker between agencies and filmmakers | 3-5 follow-up meetings booked |

**Event headline options:**
- "AI Films for Brands: What's Legal, What's Not, and What's Next"
- "The Safe Lane: How Agencies Are Using AI Video in 2026"
- "AI Content Without the Legal Exposure" (most direct)

**Why this structure works:**
- Agencies clear their calendar for legal/business content. They don't clear it for "AI film screenings."
- Filmmakers get showcased to an audience of potential paying clients — better value than a community meetup
- SI8 is positioned as the expert who organized the room — not the party host
- Every agency exec in attendance is a potential Layer 1 production client or consulting lead
- Sponsors (AI tool companies, platforms) want access to agency execs — easier to sell than a filmmaker-only event

### Event Progression (v2)

| Event | Format | Primary Audience | SI8 Position |
|-------|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| Month 3 | Half-day briefing + showcase | Agency execs + local creatives | Host + expert |
| Month 5 | Second half-day, larger | + SEA virtual attendees | Established voice |
| Year 2+ | Full-day format | Regional brands, filmmakers, platforms | Platform convener |

## Demand-Side to Supply-Side Transition (v2)

The transition plan from v1 is unchanged. What v2 makes explicit is *what drives each phase*:

**Year 1 (Demand-Side Leads):**
- Revenue: Production fees ($8-15K sprints, $2.5-7.5K/mo retainers) + consulting from events
- Brand: "Rights-cleared AI content for brands/agencies"
- Catalog: Small but vetted (3-10 pieces)
- Filmmaker relationships: Built through production work (loyalty buying) + early representation outreach
- Events: Industry briefings, demand-side content, filmmaker showcase

**Year 2 (Both Sides Active):**
- Revenue: Production + distribution commissions (catalog growing) + event sponsorships
- Brand: Both-facing (buyers AND filmmakers)
- Catalog: 10-30 pieces with real licensing history
- Filmmaker relationships: Active representation, real deals to point to
- Events: Established brand, mix of community + industry

**Year 3+ (Supply-Side Leads):**
- Revenue: Distribution commissions + catalog licensing + consulting
- Brand: "The AI film agency for APAC" — filmmaker representation front and center
- Catalog: 50+ pieces, multiple platform relationships
- Events: Flagship format, regional brand

---

## The Rights Playbook as Marketing Asset (v2 Addition)

In v1, the Rights Playbook was internal infrastructure — a knowledge base for SI8's legal operations.

In v2, the Rights Playbook is a **sales asset** — the first document a brand or agency receives after initial contact. It signals:
- SI8 has done the legal homework (expertise)
- SI8 has a documented safe lane (reliability)
- Working with SI8 reduces legal exposure (the buyer's core fear)

No other AI video producer in APAC has this. That's the differentiator.

**How it's used in the sales process:**
1. Cold outreach: pitch the "won't get you sued" angle — this is the single message for Year 1
2. Response received: send Rights Playbook + 1-page overview
3. Discovery call: walk through the safe lane and tool vetting process
4. Proposal: production package + rights documentation as deliverable
5. Close: rights clearance is part of what they're paying for

**Single message discipline (v2 decision):** The Year 1 outreach message is "won't get you sued" — one message, tested consistently before pivoting. Do not layer additional messages (speed, cost, quality) until the primary message has been tested in market. If "won't get you sued" does not generate response after 200+ touches, iterate then.

**Brand the process — do not certify pieces:** SI8 does not label individual pieces of content with a rights certificate or badge in Year 1. The differentiator is that SI8 *has a process* — documented, consistent, auditable. Branding the process (the "Safe Lane") is the right move. Certifying individual outputs creates warranty exposure SI8 cannot back up. The process is the product; the documentation is the proof.
