# SuperImmersive 8
## AI Film Distribution & Community Platform — Business Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2026
**Location:** Taipei, Taiwan

---

## Executive Summary

SuperImmersive 8 (SI8) is an AI film distribution agency and community platform positioned at the inflection point of a new creative medium. As AI-generated video tools (Veo, Kling, Runway, Firefly, Sora) mature rapidly, a wave of independent creators is producing 90%+ AI-generated films—but lacks pathways to monetization, distribution, and professional representation.

**Market Positioning:** We represent *AI films*—distinct from traditional "human-mades"—and specialize in Asia-Pacific and European distribution channels. This regional focus allows us to build market dominance before competing head-on with US-based players.

SI8 provides the "picks and shovels" infrastructure for this emerging ecosystem:

### Business Structure

```
SuperImmersive 8
│
├── CORE BUSINESS: Distribution & Licensing Agency
│   ├── Filmmaker representation (legal agreements by region)
│   └── Content licensing (streamers, schools, festivals, alt programming)
│
├── MARKETING & PIPELINE: AI Creators Fest
│   └── Events that build community, source filmmakers, and create brand visibility
│
├── DEMAND CREATION: r/aifilmreviews (subreddit)
│   └── Building audience and appetite for AI film content
│
└── FUTURE EXPANSION: Actor Likeness Micro-Licensing
    └── Platform for actors to license their likeness to AI/UGC creators
```

**Core Business — Distribution & Licensing Agency**
Representing AI filmmakers and monetizing their work across festivals, education, streaming, brand partnerships, and emerging channels. This requires robust legal frameworks for both filmmaker representation and content licensing.

**Marketing Arm — AI Creators Fest**
Live events in Taipei that aggregate the community, showcase work, and serve as the primary pipeline for discovering and signing filmmakers. The events are not a separate business — they fuel the core distribution operation.

**Demand Creation — r/aifilmreviews**
A subreddit dedicated to reviewing and discussing AI-generated films, building audience appetite and legitimizing the medium.

**Future Expansion — Actor Likeness Micro-Licensing**
A platform enabling actors to license their likeness to AI creators at micro-transaction scale (vs. traditional large studio deals). To be explored once core distribution business is validated

**Why Now:**
- AI video quality crossed the "uncanny valley" threshold in 2025
- No dominant distribution player exists for AI-native content
- Taiwan's position between Hollywood and China offers strategic advantages
- Founder's unique background spans film production, tech entrepreneurship, and immersive content distribution

**Regional Strategy:** APAC + Europe first, US later
- Competitors (Escape.ai, Curious Refuge/Promise) are US-focused
- SI8 establishes regional dominance before well-funded US players look east
- When SI8 enters US, we come with track record and case studies, not as an unknown

---

## Strategic Architecture: The Two-Layer Model

SI8 operates with a deliberate two-layer business structure designed to achieve both near-term financial viability and long-term strategic positioning.

### Layer 1: Production Services (Private — Pays the Bills)

**What it is:** B2B AI video production services for agencies and brands. SI8 becomes the "AI video production backend" that agencies can white-label.

**How it works:**
- Agencies approach SI8 for AI video production projects
- SI8 manages production using roster of AI filmmakers
- SI8 handles creative direction, quality control, and delivery
- Agencies mark up and deliver to their clients

**Revenue model:**
- Project-based fees ($5-15K per project)
- Retainers with agency partners ($2-5K/month)
- Target Year 1: $50-70K from production services

**Why it's "private":**
- Not prominently featured on website or public brand
- Acquired through B2B sales, not inbound marketing
- Leverages founder's B2B sales experience
- Is a time sink — requires managing production staff/contractors

**Strategic value beyond revenue:**
- Generates cash flow to fund distribution operations
- Creates filmmaker recruitment channel (hire AI creators → scout for roster)
- Builds agency relationships that become event attendees and consulting clients
- Develops production expertise and quality standards

### Layer 2: Distribution + Events (Public — The Real Business)

**What it is:** The scalable, passion-aligned core business — AI filmmaker representation, content licensing, and B2B events.

**How it works:**
- Represent AI filmmakers and license their work to streaming, education, festivals, brands
- Host B2B events that position SI8 as the AI video expert
- Convert event attendees to consulting clients

**Revenue model:**
- Distribution commissions (25% of deals brokered)
- Event sponsorships and tickets
- Consulting retainers from event-sourced clients
- Target Year 1: $30-50K from distribution/events/consulting

**Why it's "public":**
- Featured prominently on website and brand
- This is the passion — licensing/distribution skills scale better
- Aligns with long-term vision of AI film industry infrastructure
- Can grow with the industry as AI films become mainstream

**Strategic value:**
- Scalable (licensing doesn't require founder time per deal at scale)
- Builds industry position and brand equity
- Creates community moat via events
- Leverages founder's recent experience in content distribution

### The Relationship Between Layers

```
PRIVATE (Layer 1)              PUBLIC (Layer 2)
Production Services    →→→     Distribution & Events
     ↓                              ↓
Pays the bills               Builds the platform
     ↓                              ↓
Funds operations             Scales with industry
     ↓                              ↓
Scouts filmmakers     →→→     Signs to roster
     ↓                              ↓
Agency relationships  →→→     Event attendees + clients
```

**Key insight:** Production work IS filmmaker recruitment. When SI8 hires AI creators for agency projects, those are auditions for the distribution roster. The best performers get representation offers.

### Why This Structure Works for a Solo Founder

| Challenge | How Two-Layer Solves It |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Need revenue before distribution scales | Production provides immediate cash flow |
| Need filmmaker pipeline | Production work = scouting opportunity |
| Need credibility with agencies | Production clients become event attendees |
| Need to fund passion project | Layer 1 subsidizes Layer 2 until it scales |
| Risk of burning out on production | Layer 2 is the goal; Layer 1 is temporary |

### Productized Production Packages (Layer 1)

To prevent production from becoming "custom chaos," Layer 1 operates through two fixed packages only:

**Package 1: AI Video Pilot Sprint ($8-15K, 30 days)**
- For agencies/brands wanting to test AI video commercially
- Includes: kickoff workshop, creative brief, 12 short-form videos OR 1 hero + 6 cutdowns
- Fixed scope, fixed timeline, 2 revision rounds
- Rights & compliance wrapper included

**Package 2: Agency AI Video Retainer ($2.5-7.5K/month)**
- For agencies wanting ongoing AI video capacity
- Tiers: Starter (8 videos/mo), Growth (16 videos + 1 hero), Scale (30 videos + 2 heroes)
- White-label delivery for agency resale
- Monthly planning calls, revision rounds included

**Operational Rules:**
- No custom one-offs outside these packages
- Cap: Max 2 retainers + 1 sprint active at any time
- "General Contractor Rule": Founder never touches the tools — scope, staff, QC only

### Bridge Product (Layer 1.5)

A "bridge product" connects public brand attention to private revenue before distribution matures:

**Options under consideration:**
- AI Video Executive Briefing Council (paid membership)
- Agency Enablement Kit (training + templates + office hours)
- Rights & Risk Readiness Sprint (2-week paid engagement)

This bridge product is what makes Layer 2 economically viable before distribution scales.

### Protecting Layer 2: The Friday Rule

To prevent Layer 1 from consuming all time:
- 20% of weekly hours (e.g., Friday mornings) reserved exclusively for Layer 2
- Layer 2 activities: filmmaker sourcing, buyer development, public brand building
- Layer 1 fires are forbidden during this block
- If Layer 2 doesn't have scheduled time, it will lose

### Production as "Loyalty Buying"

The strategic value of production isn't just scouting — it's loyalty acquisition:

- If you ask a filmmaker for distribution rights cold: "What have you done for me?"
- If you pay them $3K for a commercial first, then ask to represent their short: "Yes"

Layer 1 buys the leverage required to sign Layer 2 talent.

### Conflict of Interest Management

**The tension:**
- As Distributor (Agent): Duty is to get highest price for filmmaker
- As Producer (Employer): Incentive is to pay filmmaker lowest price

**The risk:** Squeezing filmmakers on Layer 1 destroys trust for Layer 2.

**The fix:** Transparency on splits.
- "I have a $10K budget. I'm taking $4K for management/sales, you get $6K."
- Don't hide the numbers. Trust compounds.

### Transition Plan

**Year 1:** 60% production / 40% distribution
- Production generates majority of revenue
- Distribution builds credibility and deal flow
- Events launch and begin conversion

**Year 2:** 40% production / 60% distribution
- Distribution revenue grows with roster and deal pipeline
- Production becomes selective (higher-margin only)
- Begin hiring to offload production management
- *Requires:* Layer 2 becomes recurring (membership, programming fees, catalog licensing)

**Year 3+:** 20% production / 80% distribution
- Distribution is primary revenue driver
- Production is strategic only (key agency relationships, filmmaker scouting)
- SI8 is recognized as the AI film distribution leader in APAC
- *Requires:* A real distribution flywheel or platform-like offering

**What accelerates transition:**
- Anchor buyer (e.g., MyVideo commits to quarterly block)
- Retainer-style programming (platform pays monthly curation fee)
- Catalog licensing product (bundles with clear themes + usage rights)
- B2B subscription attached to events (paid council/membership)

**What blocks transition:**
- Production work becomes custom and urgent ("client fire drills")
- Distribution remains one-off, bespoke, relationship-driven
- Can't say "no" to production clients

---

## Legal & Rights Infrastructure (Core Competency)

**Tagline:** *"The trusted operator at the intersection of AI creators, rights, and commercial deployment."*

SI8's positioning depends on being the expert who helps creators and brands navigate AI video **safely and legally**. This requires deep understanding of the evolving AI content legal landscape — not just contracts, but the underlying rights issues.

### Why Legal Expertise is a Moat

Most agencies and filmmakers are confused about AI rights:
- Can AI-generated content be copyrighted?
- Who owns the output?
- What liability exposure exists from training data?
- What do platforms require for AI content?

**If SI8 becomes the expert who can answer these questions, that's a defensible competitive advantage.** Neither Escape.ai (platform model) nor Promise (production studio) are positioning around rights expertise.

### Key Legal Areas to Master

| Area | Why It Matters | Who Cares |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **AI Copyright (by jurisdiction)** | Can AI content be copyrighted? Who owns it? | Filmmakers, platforms |
| **Training Data Rights** | Was the AI model trained legally? Liability exposure? | Agencies, brands |
| **Likeness & Voice Rights** | Using real people's faces/voices in AI content | Brands, agencies |
| **Platform Policies** | What do streaming platforms require/prohibit for AI content? | Distribution deals |
| **Disclosure Requirements** | When must content be labeled as AI-generated? | Brands, platforms |
| **Music & Audio Rights** | AI-generated music, sound effects, voice cloning | All productions |
| **Brand Safety** | What makes AI content "safe" for brand association? | Agencies, brands |
| **International Differences** | US vs EU vs APAC regulations | Cross-border deals |

### Legal as Sales Asset

**For Filmmakers:**
> "We've done the legal homework. We know which platforms accept AI content, what disclosures are required, and how to protect your rights."

**For Agencies:**
> "We handle the rights complexity so you don't have to. Every project comes with a rights clearance checklist and brand safety documentation."

**For Distribution:**
> "Our content comes with clear provenance, proper licensing, and platform-ready compliance."

### Deliverables (Year 1)

| Deliverable | Purpose | Timeline |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **AI Video Rights Playbook** | Internal knowledge base | Build throughout Year 1 |
| **Rights Checklist** | For every production project | Month 3 |
| **Brand Safety Guidelines** | For agency clients | Month 3 |
| **Client-Facing Rights Assessment** | Sales tool | Month 5 |
| **Platform Requirements Database** | What each platform needs | Ongoing |

### Potential Future Products

- **"AI Video Rights Audit"** — standalone consulting offering ($2-3K)
- **"AI Video Rights Playbook"** — packaged knowledge product
- **"Rights-Cleared Creator Network"** — pre-vetted filmmakers with clean processes

## Problem & Opportunity

### The Problem

**For AI Filmmakers:**
- No clear monetization pathways for AI-generated content
- Traditional film festivals and distributors are skeptical or hostile
- Fragmented community with no central hub or professional network
- Unclear IP/licensing frameworks for AI-generated work
- Difficulty getting taken seriously by mainstream industry

**For Buyers (Studios, Brands, Educators, Streamers):**
- Overwhelming volume of AI content with inconsistent quality
- No trusted source for curated, licensable AI films
- Legal uncertainty around AI content rights
- Difficulty finding creators for commissioned work

### The Opportunity

The AI film market mirrors where "vibe coding" was in 2023-2024:
- Traditional industry initially pushes back
- Independent creators adopt first
- Professionals eventually integrate AI as force multiplier

**We are at the inflection point.** The winner in AI film distribution will be whoever:
1. Aggregates the best creators first
2. Builds the trusted brand for quality curation
3. Establishes the legal/licensing frameworks
4. Creates the community hub (online + offline)

SI8 is positioned to be that winner in the Asia-Pacific region, with global expansion potential.

## Brand Positioning: AI Films vs. Human-Mades

### Defining the Category

SI8 deliberately positions itself in a new content category: **AI Films**. We introduce the term "human-mades" to describe traditional filmmaking—content created through conventional production methods (physical cameras, sets, human actors on location).

| Term | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| **AI Films** | Content where 90%+ of visuals are AI-generated; human creative direction with AI execution | AI shorts, AI music videos, AI commercials |
| **AI-Assisted** | Traditional production enhanced with AI tools (VFX, color, editing) | Hollywood films using AI for post-production |
| **Human-Mades** | Traditional production methods (cameras, sets, actors, locations) | Conventional film/TV, indie productions |

### Why This Framing Matters

1. **Creates a distinct category** — AI films are not "fake" or "lesser" versions of human-mades; they're a different medium entirely
2. **Avoids direct comparison** — We're not competing with Hollywood; we're building a parallel ecosystem
3. **Positions human-mades as legacy** — Subtle implication that traditional methods are the "old way" (without being antagonistic)
4. **Gives buyers a clear choice** — "Do you want AI films or human-mades for this project?"

### Messaging Guidelines

**Do say:**
- "We represent AI filmmakers and their work"
- "AI films offer unique creative possibilities"
- "Looking for human-mades? That's not what we do—we specialize in AI films"

**Don't say:**
- "AI-generated content" (sounds clinical)
- "Synthetic video" (sounds artificial)
- "Fake" or "deepfake" (negative connotations)
- "Better than human-made" (antagonistic, unnecessary)

### Brand Voice

SI8 speaks confidently about AI films as a legitimate artistic medium. We don't apologize for AI or position it as a budget alternative to "real" filmmaking. AI films are a new form of creative expression—distinct from human-mades—with their own aesthetics, possibilities, and audience.

## Legal Framework Requirements

The distribution business requires two categories of legal agreements:

### A. Filmmaker Representation Agreements

**Purpose:** Establish SI8's authority to represent and license a filmmaker's work

**Key Terms to Address:**
- **Scope of Representation:** Which works are covered, exclusivity vs. non-exclusive
- **Territory:** Geographic regions covered (global, Asia-Pacific, specific countries)
- **Duration:** Term of agreement, renewal conditions, termination rights
- **Commission Structure:** Percentage (25% standard), when commission is earned
- **Rights Granted:** What SI8 can do (submit to festivals, negotiate licenses, marketing)
- **Rights Retained:** What filmmaker keeps (final approval, creative control, direct sales below threshold)
- **AI-Specific Clauses:**
  - Disclosure of AI tools used in production
  - Warranties regarding training data / IP clearance
  - Indemnification for AI-related claims
- **Accounting & Payment:** Payment timing, reporting frequency, audit rights

**Regional Variations Needed:**
| Region | Key Considerations |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Taiwan (ROC)** | Base jurisdiction; Copyright Act, contract law |
| **United States** | Copyright registration, work-for-hire doctrine, state variations |
| **European Union** | GDPR for any personal data, moral rights, AI Act implications |
| **China (PRC)** | Complex IP enforcement, local entity requirements |
| **Japan/Korea** | Strong IP protection, specific licensing norms |

### B. Content Licensing Agreements

**Purpose:** License represented content to buyers (streamers, schools, festivals, etc.)

**Agreement Types by Buyer Category:**

#### 1. Streaming/VOD Licensing
- **License Type:** Exclusive or non-exclusive, SVOD/AVOD/TVOD
- **Territory:** Which countries/regions
- **Term:** Duration (typically 1-3 years)
- **Payment:** Flat fee, revenue share, or MG + backend
- **Delivery:** Technical specifications, materials required
- **Marketing:** Promotional rights, credits, artwork usage

#### 2. Educational Licensing
- **License Type:** Institutional use, classroom screening, curriculum integration
- **Territory:** Campus-only, district-wide, online learning platforms
- **Term:** Annual renewal or perpetual
- **Payment:** Per-seat, per-institution, or site license
- **Usage Rights:** Clips vs. full work, modification rights, student projects

#### 3. Festival Licensing
- **License Type:** Festival screening rights
- **Territory:** Festival location + online if hybrid
- **Term:** Festival run (typically limited days/weeks)
- **Payment:** Screening fee (often modest), premiere status considerations
- **Requirements:** Premiere status (world/international/regional), holdbacks

#### 4. Alternative Programming (Museums, Galleries, Events)
- **License Type:** Exhibition, installation, live event
- **Territory:** Venue-specific
- **Term:** Exhibition run
- **Payment:** Flat fee, sometimes attendance-based
- **Technical:** Display specifications, looping, interactivity

- **License Type:** Sponsored content, branded integration, advertising
- **Territory:** Campaign-specific
- **Term:** Campaign duration + usage extension
- **Payment:** Project fee, usage fees, talent fees if applicable
- **Approval:** Brand review process, revision rounds, final approval

### C. AI-Specific Legal Considerations

**Copyright Status:**
- AI-generated content has uncertain copyright status in many jurisdictions
- US Copyright Office requires "human authorship" — pure AI output may not be protectable
- Strategy: Position represented works as "AI-assisted" with human creative direction

**Training Data / IP Clearance:**
- Filmmakers should warrant they have not used copyrighted material inappropriately
- SI8 should include indemnification clauses
- Consider requiring disclosure of tools/models used

**Actor Likeness / Deepfakes:**
- Many jurisdictions have publicity rights laws
- Some US states have specific deepfake legislation
- Require filmmaker warranties on likeness clearance

**Disclosure Requirements:**
- Some platforms/festivals may require AI disclosure
- Consider proactive disclosure as brand positioning (transparency)

### D. Legal Priorities (Year 1)

| Priority | Document | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Filmmaker Representation Agreement (Taiwan/Global) | To create |
| 2 | Standard Licensing Agreement (Template) | To create |
| 3 | Festival Submission Agreement | To create |
| 4 | Website Terms of Service | To create |
| 5 | Privacy Policy | To create |

**Recommended Approach:**
- Engage entertainment lawyer familiar with Taiwan + US law
- Start with template agreements, customize per deal
- Build clause library for common variations
- Track regulatory developments in AI content

## Distribution Channel Strategy

**Key Insight:** Distribution channels and filmmaker acquisition must happen in parallel. Filmmakers won't sign without distribution access; distribution channels won't commit without content.

**Solution:** Secure channel commitments/LOIs first, use those to attract filmmakers.

**Regional Focus:** APAC + Europe channels first; US channels in Phase 2.

### Channel Categories

## Target Market

### Geographic Strategy: Parallel Tracks

SI8 pursues two geographic tracks simultaneously, each serving a different layer of the business:

```
TRACK 1: MyVideo / Taiwan              TRACK 2: SEA Agencies
├── Distribution credibility           ├── Production revenue (Layer 1)
├── Warm lead (Jamie Lin)              ├── English-speaking market
├── Close in 60-90 days                ├── Remote outreach
└── "We're on Taiwan Mobile"           └── $5K+/month target
         ↓                                      ↓
         └──────── Credibility accelerates agency closes ────────┘
```

**Track 1: MyVideo / Taiwan (Distribution Credibility)**
- **Asset:** Warm lead with Jamie Lin (Chairman, Taiwan Mobile)
- **Goal:** Close pilot deal for AI shorts programming
- **Timeline:** 60-90 days
- **Strategic value:** "We program AI content for Taiwan Mobile's streaming platform" opens every door
- **Language:** Mandarin (with English possible given relationship)

**Track 2: SEA Agencies (Production Revenue)**
- **Why SEA:** Larger agency budgets, familiar with global AI tools, English as business language
- **Target cities:** Singapore (priority), Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Jakarta
- **Outreach method:** Remote/digital (LinkedIn, email, video calls)
- **Goal:** 2 retainer clients by Month 6 → $5K+/month production revenue
- **Language:** English

**How Tracks Reinforce Each Other:**
- MyVideo deal → instant credibility → SEA agencies take you seriously
- SEA production work → hire filmmakers → sign them for distribution
- Agency relationships → event attendees → consulting clients

### Regional Priority Matrix

| Region | Layer 1 (Production) | Layer 2 (Distribution) | Priority |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|----------|
| **Southeast Asia** | PRIMARY — agency outreach | Secondary — emerging platforms | **Track 2** |
| **Taiwan** | Secondary — local agencies | PRIMARY — MyVideo warm lead | **Track 1** |
| **Japan/Korea** | Future | Future — OTT, festivals | Phase 2 |
| **Europe** | Future | Future — arthouse, festivals | Phase 2 |
| **US** | Avoid | Avoid (for now) | Phase 3 (2027+) |

### Why This Strategy Works

| Traditional Approach | SI8 Parallel Approach |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Pick one market, go deep | Run two tracks, let them reinforce |
| Wait for distribution before revenue | Production generates revenue while distribution builds |
| Cold outreach without credibility | MyVideo win accelerates all conversations |
| Taiwan-only limits scale | SEA expands addressable market 5-10x |

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

SI8's SAM is defined by: **AI video content + APAC/Europe distribution + agency representation model**

#### SAM Calculation

| Market Segment | Size | SI8's Slice | Rationale |
|----------------|------|-------------|-----------|
| **APAC Streaming Content Acquisition** | ~$5-10B annually | $50-100M (AI content portion) | AI content = 1-2% of content budgets initially |
| **Brand AI Video Production (APAC)** | ~$500M (emerging) | $50-100M | Agencies adopting AI video production |
| **Educational/Institutional Licensing** | ~$37B globally (digital education video = 40%) | $10-20M (APAC) | Universities, museums, corporate training |
| **In-Flight Entertainment** | $300M+ globally (content licensing) | $5-10M | Short films fill programming gaps |

**Total SAM: $100-230M** (Year 1-3 addressable market in APAC + Europe for AI video distribution and production)

#### SAM Growth Drivers

**1. Brand/Agency AI Video Adoption (Validated)**
- 22% of video ad creative was AI-built/enhanced in 2024
- Expected to reach 39% by 2026 (nearly doubling)
- 86% of ad buyers are using or planning to use GenAI for video ads
- Mondelez cut video production costs by 50% using AI tools
- Small/mid-tier brands adopting faster than large brands (45% vs 36% AI-generated by 2026)

**2. Digital Video Ad Spend (Context)**
- US digital video ad spend: $64B (2024) → $72B (2025), growing 2-3x faster than total media
- Global digital ad spend: Projected to exceed $740B by 2026

*Source: [IAB](https://www.iab.com/insights/video-ad-spend-report-2025/)*

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

**Year 1 SOM: $80-120K** (realistic for solo founder, part-time)

| Revenue Stream | Target | Unit Economics |
|----------------|--------|----------------|
| Production Services (Layer 1) | $50-70K | 2 retainers × $3K/mo + 2-3 sprints × $10K |
| Distribution Commissions | $5-10K | $20-40K in deals × 25% commission |
| Event Sponsorships | $10-20K | 2-3 events × $5-7K sponsorship |
| Consulting (from events) | $15-30K | 2-3 clients × $5-10K projects |

**Year 3 SOM: $300-500K** (with team, scaled operations)

**Year 5 SOM: $1-2M** (regional market leader position)

### Comparable Transaction Benchmarks

#### Content Licensing Fees

| Channel | Fee Range | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **In-Flight Entertainment** | $5,000 - $90,000 per title | Largest airlines pay up to $90K for 2-3 month license; short films valuable for programming gaps |
| **Streaming Platforms (Indies)** | $40,000 - $60,000 per film | Netflix low-end for independent/low-budget features |
| **FAST Channels** | Revenue share | Lower barrier to entry; "relatively cheap licensing fees" |
| **Educational Institutions** | $1,000 - $10,000 per title | Annual or perpetual licenses |
| **Festival Licensing** | $500 - $5,000 per film | Screening fees vary by festival prestige |

**Key insight for SI8:** AI shorts are novel programming that can differentiate airline and streaming offerings. Short-form content fills gaps that features cannot.

#### Talent Agency Commission Rates

| Work Type | Standard Commission | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Union (SAG-AFTRA) | 10% | Capped by regulation |
| Non-Union | 15-20% | Industry standard |
| Print/Commercial | 20% | Common for advertising work |
| Managers (vs Agents) | 15-20% | In addition to agent fees |

**SI8's 25% commission** is at the high end but justified by:
- Full-service representation (not just booking)
- Legal/rights infrastructure in uncertain AI landscape
- Non-exclusive agreements (filmmakers can self-distribute)
- No upfront fees (commission only when deals close)

### Competitor Funding & Validation

| Company | Funding | Investors | Validation Signal |
|---------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Promise** (acquired Curious Refuge) | Seed round (undisclosed) + follow-on | Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Peter Chernin's North Road Co., Google AI Futures Fund, Crossbeam, Michael Ovitz | Top-tier VC backing validates AI entertainment thesis |
| **Escape.ai** | Raising new round (amount undisclosed) | Advisory: Kiri Hart (Pixar), Tony Driscoll (ex-Disney/Epic), Andrew Schneider (ex-Disney+) | Hollywood credibility, platform play |
| **Runway** | $141M Series D (Dec 2024) | Valued at $4B+ | AI video tools leader exploring vertical integration |

**Key insight:** Well-funded competitors validate the market opportunity. Their focus on US/platform models leaves APAC/agency model open for SI8.

*Sources: [Variety](https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/promise-gen-ai-studio-funding-peter-chernin-andreessen-horowitz-1236214333/), [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/ai-entertainment-studio-promise-acquires-ai-film-school-curious-refuge-1236142985/), [GamesBeat](https://gamesbeat.com/john-gaetas-escape-ai-creates-platform-for-emerging-entertainment/)*

### Why APAC + Europe Now

| Factor | APAC Advantage | Europe Advantage |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Market Growth** | 22-24% CAGR (fastest globally) | Stable, premium content appetite |
| **Competition** | No AI film agency presence | Arthouse culture receptive to experimental |
| **Buyer Psychology** | Tech-forward, early adopter markets | Art film tradition, institutional buyers |
| **SI8 Position** | Founder based in Taipei; Jamie Lin warm lead | Natural expansion after APAC validation |

**The gap:** US players (Escape.ai, Promise) are focused domestically. By the time they look east, SI8 will be the incumbent with relationships, case studies, and regional brand recognition.

### Market Timing

**Why 2026 is the right moment:**

1. **Quality threshold crossed:** AI video tools (Runway Gen-3, Sora, Kling, Veo) now produce broadcast-quality output
2. **Adoption accelerating:** 86% of ad buyers using or planning to use GenAI for video
3. **Legal frameworks forming:** First AI-specific content guidelines emerging; early movers who establish "safe" practices win
4. **Competition still forming:** Escape.ai in beta, Promise just acquired Curious Refuge — window to establish regional position before market consolidates

**The risk of waiting:** If SI8 doesn't move in 2026, well-funded US players may expand to APAC by 2027-2028 with resources SI8 can't match.

### Investment Thesis Summary

**For angel investors:**

1. **Large, growing TAM:** AI video market growing 20-36% CAGR; APAC streaming growing 22.6% CAGR
2. **Validated demand:** 86% of ad buyers adopting AI video; major brands (Mondelez) cutting costs 50%
3. **Clear beachhead:** APAC + Europe underserved; no regional AI film agency competitor
4. **Warm distribution lead:** Taiwan Mobile Chairman expressed interest in AI shorts programming
5. **Experienced founder:** 10+ years B2B enterprise sales; proven events → consulting conversion
6. **Capital efficient:** Two-layer model (production funds distribution) reduces cash burn
7. **Multiple revenue streams:** Production, distribution, events, consulting — diversified risk
8. **Exit potential:** Strategic acquisition by US players expanding regionally, or platform companies seeking content/creator relationships

## Competitive Landscape

*Updated: January 2026 — Based on comprehensive market research*

### Direct Competitors

#### 1. Escape.ai — PRIMARY THREAT

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Founder** | John Gaeta (Oscar-winning VFX, The Matrix "bullet time", Lucasfilm, Epic Games) |
| **What they do** | Neo-cinema content distribution platform + creator marketplace |
| **Model** | Creators monetize via fan support, merch, subscriptions. Creators keep IP. |
| **Backing** | Advisory board includes Kiri Hart (Lucasfilm/Pixar), Eric Berger (Sony/Crackle), Kevin Kay (Paramount) |
| **Status** | Beta launched 2025 |
| **Threat level** | **HIGH** — Same thesis, better funded, Hollywood credibility |

**Key Differentiator from SI8:** Escape.ai is a *platform* where creators self-monetize. SI8 is an *agency* that represents creators and brokers deals on their behalf.

#### 2. Curious Refuge / Promise — COMMUNITY THREAT

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **What they do** | World's largest AI filmmaking community (50,000+ members), education courses |
| **Acquired by** | Promise (AI entertainment studio backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Chernin's North Road) — Feb 2025 |
| **Model** | Courses, B2B training, community → now embedded in active production studio |
| **Scale** | 4,000+ course graduates from 171 countries; training used by major studios |
| **Threat level** | **MEDIUM-HIGH** — They own the education funnel; Promise has production/distribution capability |

**Key Differentiator from SI8:** Curious Refuge is education-first. SI8 is distribution-first. However, Promise acquisition creates potential for them to expand into representation.

### AI Film Festivals (Competing for Filmmaker Attention)

| Festival | Location | Key Details | Threat Level |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Runway AIFF** | NYC/LA | 3rd year (est. 2022). Backed by Runway. Gala screenings, prestigious. | High |
| **AI International Film Festival** | Hollywood | "World's first" (since 2021). OpenAI speakers. Feb 2026. | Medium |
| **World AI Film Festival (WAiFF)** | Kyoto, São Paulo, Seoul, Cannes | Gong Li as jury president 2026. Multi-city presence. | High |
| **AI Film Awards Cannes** | Cannes | May 2026. 100% AI-generated requirement. Prestigious location. | Medium |
| **1 Billion Summit AI Film Award** | Dubai | $1M prize (!). Google Gemini partnership. Jan 2026. | Medium |
| **MetaMorph AI Award** | UK | Judges: John Rhys-Davies, David Nutter, Timbaland team. | Low |
| **AI for Good Film Festival** | ITU Global Summit | July 2026. Institutional backing. | Low |

**Implication for AI Creators Fest:** Festival landscape is crowded globally. SI8 differentiates via:
- Asia-Pacific regional focus (no strong competitor in Taiwan)
- Year-round community building (not just annual competition)
- Pipeline to representation (festivals → agency relationship)

### Content Licensing Platforms (Adjacent)

| Platform | Focus | Model | Threat to SI8 |
|----------|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Vitrina.ai** | Film/TV supply chain intelligence | B2B data platform. Netflix, WBD clients. | Low (not creator-facing) |
| **Veritone** | Content licensing + AI search | Enterprise rights clearance for documentarians. | Low (different segment) |
| **Allrites** | TV/Film content marketplace | Traditional content licensing. | Low (not AI-focused) |
| **Versos** | Video licensing for AI training | Sells creator footage TO AI companies. | Low (different direction) |

**Gap Confirmed:** No dedicated AI film distribution agency exists at scale. Escape.ai is closest but is platform model, not agency model.

### Actor Likeness Licensing (Future Expansion Landscape)

| Player | Focus | Gap for SI8 |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **ElevenLabs Iconic Voices** | Voice licensing marketplace (McConaughey, Judy Garland, etc.) | Voice only. Celebrity-tier only. No indie access. |
| **Hour One** | AI avatar creation from regular people | B2B marketing focus. Not actor marketplace. |
| **Synthesia** | Enterprise AI video avatars | Select face/language/tone. Not marketplace. |
| **Xicoia / Tilly Norwood** | AI actress seeking agency representation | Creating AI talent, not licensing human actors. |

**Opportunity Confirmed:** No micro-licensing marketplace exists for actors → indie AI creators. ElevenLabs proves the model for voice; visual equivalent is open.

### Revised Competitive Positioning

#### Original Assumption vs. Reality

| Assumption | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| "No dominant player exists" | Escape.ai and Curious Refuge/Promise are emerging fast with serious backing |
| "First mover advantage" | First mover in *Asia-Pacific* holds; globally, competition is forming |
| "Nascent market" | Market is nascent but moving quickly — 2026 is critical year |

#### SI8 Differentiation Strategy

| Competitor | Their Strength | SI8 Counter-Position |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Escape.ai** | Hollywood pedigree, platform tech, US-based | Asia-Pacific focus, agency model (we represent you), legal infrastructure |
| **Curious Refuge/Promise** | 50K community, education flywheel, studio backing | Distribution-first (not education), events as pipeline not product |
| **Runway AIFF** | Brand prestige, tool integration | Year-round community relationship, representation services |
| **WAiFF** | Multi-city, Cannes credibility | Taipei home base, regional depth over geographic breadth |

### Sustainable Competitive Advantages

1. **Agency Model** — Not a platform (Escape.ai) or school (Curious Refuge). We represent creators and broker deals. Personal relationship + legal infrastructure.

2. **APAC + Europe Focus** — No serious competitor has regional focus. While US players fight for Hollywood, SI8 owns the rest of the world. Taiwan as bridge to Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia; European art film culture as second beachhead.

3. **Legal Infrastructure as Product** — Contracts and licensing clarity in a legally uncertain space. This is the actual value we provide.

4. **Community via Events** — AI Creators Fest as ongoing relationship builder, not annual prize competition. Pipeline to representation.

5. **Category Definition** — "AI Films vs. Human-Mades" positioning establishes SI8 as the voice of a new medium, not a niche within traditional film.

6. **Founder Network** — Family connections in LA/Taipei post-production. Sales/BD background from tech startups.

### Competitors to Watch

| Company | Watch For |
|---------|-----------|
| **Escape.ai** | Expansion to Asia. Shift toward representation services. |
| **Promise** | Leveraging Curious Refuge community for distribution deals. |
| **Runway** | Vertical integration from tools → distribution. |
| **Traditional agencies (CAA, WME, UTA)** | Creating AI creator divisions. |
| **Regional players** | Any AI film activity in Taiwan, Japan, Korea. |

## Risk Analysis

*Updated: January 2026 — Comprehensive failure mode analysis*

### Critical Risks (Could Kill the Business)

#### 1. Market Risk: AI Film Never Becomes a "Real" Medium
- **Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Fatal
- **The fear:** AI-generated film remains a novelty, never achieving mainstream legitimacy
- **Why it could happen:** Audience rejection, quality plateau, Hollywood gatekeeping, cultural backlash
- **Mitigation:** Monitor adoption signals closely; be prepared to pivot to adjacent markets (VR, interactive, brand content)
- **Kill switch:** If no buyer pays real money for AI content by Q3 2026, reassess entire thesis

#### 2. Legal/Regulatory Risk: The Rug Gets Pulled
- **Likelihood:** Medium-High | **Impact:** Potentially Fatal
- **The fear:** Copyright law or regulations make AI content legally toxic
- **Why it could happen:**
  - US Copyright Office rules AI content unprotectable
  - Training data lawsuits taint all AI content
  - Likeness/deepfake laws create liability
  - Platforms ban AI content
- **Mitigation:** Build legal expertise as core differentiator; conservative licensing practices; require filmmaker warranties; track regulatory developments obsessively
- **Kill switch:** If major platform bans AI content or landmark lawsuit creates liability, reassess

#### 3. Demand-Side Risk: Buyers Won't Pay
- **Likelihood:** Medium-High | **Impact:** High
- **The fear:** Streamers, educators, brands don't see AI content as worth licensing
- **Why it could happen:** Perceived lower value, unlimited supply depresses prices, copyright uncertainty, no proven audience
- **Mitigation:** Start with most likely buyer categories (educators, brands); prove value with early deals; build case studies
- **Validation needed:** Close 1 real deal (any size) by Q2 2026

### High-Priority Risks

#### 4. Supply-Side Risk: Filmmakers Don't Need Us
- **Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High
- **The fear:** AI filmmakers can self-distribute and don't see value in representation
- **Why it could happen:** Direct-to-audience works better; 25% feels too high; Escape.ai platform more appealing
- **Mitigation:** Demonstrate deals we can close that filmmakers can't; emphasize legal/contract value; start with filmmakers who want help, not those who don't
- **Validation needed:** Sign 3 filmmakers who actively want representation by Q2 2026

#### 5. Competition Risk: We Get Crushed
- **Likelihood:** Medium-High | **Impact:** High
- **Specific threats:**
  - Escape.ai: Hollywood credibility, better funded, platform scale
  - Curious Refuge/Promise: 50K community, studio backing
  - Runway: Could vertically integrate tools → distribution
  - Traditional agencies: Could create AI divisions
- **Mitigation:** Win Asia-Pacific before competing globally; agency model vs. platform model differentiation; move fast
- **Watch closely:** Escape.ai Asia expansion; Promise distribution moves; Runway vertical integration signals

#### 6. Timing Risk: Too Early or Too Late
- **Likelihood:** Medium-High | **Impact:** High
- **Too early:** Filmmakers not ready to monetize; buyers not ready to pay; legal frameworks don't exist
- **Too late:** Escape.ai or Promise already locked up market; traditional agencies moved in
- **Mitigation:** Stay lean; don't over-build infrastructure before validation; monitor competitor velocity
- **Key indicator:** If Escape.ai announces Asia expansion, accelerate timeline

#### 7. Business Model Risk: Commission Model Doesn't Work
- **Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High
- **The fear:** Unit economics don't pencil out
- **Why it could happen:** Deal sizes too small (25% of $500 = $125); volume too low; disintermediation after first deal
- **Mitigation:** Test pricing early; consider hybrid models (retainer + commission); focus on larger deal categories (brands, streaming)
- **Validation needed:** Model out actual deal sizes from first 3-5 deals

### Medium-Priority Risks

#### 8. Execution Risk: Solo Founder, Limited Resources
- **Likelihood:** High | **Impact:** Medium-High
- **The fear:** Can't do everything needed with one person
- **What needs to happen:** Events + filmmaker signing + buyer deals + legal + community + content + operations
- **Mitigation:** Ruthless prioritization; contractors for events; don't try to do everything at once
- **Accept:** Progress will be slower than funded competitors

#### 9. Geographic Risk: Taiwan Is Wrong Hub
- **Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium
- **The fear:** Asia-Pacific isn't where AI film happens; action stays in LA/NYC
- **Mitigation:** Stay flexible on location; maintain US connections; consider Taiwan as "base" not "limit"
- **Watch for:** Where top filmmakers actually are; where buyers actually are

#### 10. Events Risk: AI Creators Fest Fails to Launch
- **Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium-High
- **The fear:** Events don't attract attendance, sponsors, or pipeline
- **Mitigation:** Start very small (30 people); validate before scaling; don't bet everything on events
- **Validation needed:** First event has 30+ attendees with positive feedback

#### 11. Technology Risk: Tools Change Everything
- **Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium
- **The fear:** AI video tech evolves so fast that today's content is worthless tomorrow
- **Mitigation:** Accept content may be ephemeral; focus on creator relationships (durable) not specific works (perishable)

#### 12. Reputation Risk: AI Content Stigma
- **Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium
- **The fear:** Association with AI content damages brand; AI content never shakes stigma
- **Mitigation:** Quality curation; transparent positioning; avoid "AI slop" association

### Risk Matrix Summary

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Priority |
|------|------------|--------|----------|
| Legal/Regulatory | Medium-High | Fatal | **CRITICAL** |
| Buyers Won't Pay | Medium-High | High | **CRITICAL** |
| Market Never Materializes | Medium | Fatal | **HIGH** |
| Competition | Medium-High | High | **HIGH** |
| Timing | Medium-High | High | **HIGH** |
| Filmmakers Don't Need Us | Medium | High | **HIGH** |
| Business Model | Medium | High | **MEDIUM** |
| Execution/Resources | High | Medium-High | **MEDIUM** |
| Events Fail | Medium | Medium-High | **MEDIUM** |
| Taiwan Wrong Hub | Medium | Medium | **LOW** |
| Technology Changes | Medium | Medium | **LOW** |
| Reputation/Stigma | Medium | Medium | **LOW** |

### Most Likely Path to Failure

1. Legal uncertainty makes buyers unwilling to license
2. Combined with filmmakers not seeing value in representation (self-distribution works fine)
3. Combined with Escape.ai or Promise winning the US/global market first
4. = SI8 stuck in small regional niche with deals too small to sustain operations

### What Must Go Right

For SI8 to succeed, the following must happen:

1. **Legal clarity emerges** — or SI8 becomes the trusted "clean licensing" source in uncertain landscape
2. **At least one buyer category validates** — someone pays real money for AI content
3. **AI Creators Fest builds genuine community** — becomes the pipeline for filmmaker recruitment
4. **Sign 5-10 filmmakers who generate licensing interest** — prove the agency model works
5. **Competition stays fragmented** — long enough to establish regional position

### Assumptions to Validate (Prioritized)

| Assumption | Validation Method | Deadline | Kill if False? |
|------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| Buyers will pay for AI content | Close 1 deal, any size | Q2 2026 | Yes |
| Filmmakers want representation | Sign 3 filmmakers | Q2 2026 | Yes |
| Commission model is viable | Analyze first 3-5 deals | Q3 2026 | Pivot model |
| Taipei works as hub | Event attendance, filmmaker interest | Q2 2026 | Relocate focus |
| Sponsors interested in events | Secure 1 sponsor | Q2 2026 | No (events can be loss leader) |

## Future Expansion Opportunities

### A. r/aifilmreviews — Demand Creation

**Status:** Active (early stage)

**Thesis:**
For AI film to succeed as a medium, there needs to be audience demand — not just creator supply. By reviewing and discussing AI films publicly, we:
- Legitimize the medium (treating it as worthy of critique)
- Build audience familiarity and appetite
- Create discovery mechanism for quality work
- Position SI8 as taste-maker / authority

**Strategy:**
- Post consistent reviews (2-3x/week)
- Develop review framework specific to AI film
- Engage with community, cross-post to related subreddits
- Eventually link to SI8 represented works / AI Creators Fest

**Success Metrics:**
- Subscriber growth
- Post engagement (upvotes, comments)
- Cross-platform mentions
- Filmmaker submissions for review

**Integration with Core Business:**
- Reviews create awareness of AI film as legitimate medium
- Reviewed filmmakers become leads for representation
- Builds SI8 credibility as curator / tastemaker

### B. Actor Likeness Micro-Licensing Platform

**Status:** Concept (future exploration)

**The Opportunity:**
As AI filmmakers create narrative content, they need characters. Options today:
1. Fully synthetic characters (uncanny, limited range)
2. Licensed celebrity likenesses (expensive, complex, inaccessible)
3. Unauthorized use (legal risk)

There is no platform enabling actors to easily license their likeness to indie/AI creators at micro-transaction scale.

**Market Gap:**
| Segment | Current Options |
|---------|----------------|
| Big studios | Bespoke deals with agencies, $100K+ |
| Mid-tier productions | Difficult negotiations, limited access |
| Indie / AI creators | No legitimate pathway |

**Potential Model:**
- Actors upload likeness package (photos, voice samples, consent)
- Set pricing tiers (non-commercial, commercial, exclusivity)
- Creators browse, license, receive assets
- Platform takes transaction fee (15-25%)

**Why SI8:**
- Already working with AI filmmakers (distribution clients become licensing clients)
- Understands creator needs and workflows
- Can bundle with representation services

**Risks & Challenges:**
- Deepfake concerns and regulation
- Actor willingness to participate
- Quality control and brand safety
- Union/guild considerations (SAG-AFTRA)
- Technical implementation

**Timing:**
Explore after core distribution business is validated (2027+). Watch market for:
- Regulatory clarity on AI likenesses
- Actor sentiment / early adopters
- Competitive entrants
