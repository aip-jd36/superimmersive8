Below is what I could substantiate with primary sources (statutes / official guidance / enacted law text / platform policy pages), plus what I could not find as "proven in court for AI video specifically" (yet). This should give you a defensible "evidence spine" for SI8 messaging.

## Section 1: Damage mitigation evidence (statutory + case-law principles)

### Finding 1 — Statutory damages ranges (baseline vs. willful vs. innocent)

**Source:** 17 U.S.C. § 504(c) (statutory text)

**Key facts (statute):**

- Standard statutory damages: $750–$30,000 per work (court discretion).
- Willful infringement: up to $150,000 per work.
- "Innocent infringement": court may reduce to as low as $200 per work.

**Direct quote (short, compliant):** The court may reduce to "not less than $200" for innocent infringement.

**Relevance to SI8:**

- Chain of Title = evidence of "good-faith / due diligence." It doesn't guarantee innocent infringer treatment, but it's the kind of record you'd want if you're arguing "we tried to do this responsibly."
- Validates Chain of Title fields: #1 (Tool provenance), #3 (Rights Verified sign-off), #4 (Commercial use authorization), #9 (Version history).

**Can you cite in marketing?** Yes (statute).

**Quantifiable impact (math):**

- Minimum reduction from $750 → $200 is 73.3% lower ((750-200)/750).

**Important limitation:** "Innocent infringer" is not available if the work had a proper copyright notice in many situations (and courts vary in practice). 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2) includes constraints.

### Finding 2 — Documentation helps most in the "willfulness" fight (even if you still lose)

**Source:** Same statutory framework (willful vs. innocent damages are explicitly separated)

**Key idea you can safely claim:** Your process logging is most defensible as "we reduced the risk of a willfulness finding" (i.e., you weren't reckless). That's often the difference between a catastrophic statutory-damages posture and a survivable one.

**Relevance to SI8:** This is the cleanest "documentation reduces risk" claim that stays inside what the statute supports.

**Chain of Title fields:** #1, #3, #4, #9.

---

## Section 2: Vicarious liability protection (what you can and can't prove)

### What the law generally cares about (high level, defensible framing)

- Brands/commissioners can face liability under direct, contributory, or vicarious theories depending on facts (control, knowledge, financial benefit, etc.).
- Documentation doesn't "break liability" automatically, but it can help show:
  - You attempted to obtain permissions / avoid prohibited inputs/outputs.
  - You had compliance controls (process, logs, restrictions).
  - You weren't encouraging infringement.

**What I did not find (as of this research):**

- A clean, citable 2024–2026 court precedent that says "provenance logs for generative AI outputs materially reduce a brand's liability" in a way you can quote for marketing. That case law is still emerging and fact-specific.

**How to message this without overpromising:**

- "Creates an audit trail that supports good-faith compliance and lowers the chance of aggravated damages / willfulness." (Strongly supportable from §504(c) structure.)
- "Improves defensibility in clearance and vendor-management decisions." (Supportable as a practical/legal ops claim, not a court guarantee.)

---

## Section 3: Regulatory compliance requirements (2025–2026+) you can point to

### Finding 3 — EU AI Act transparency obligations for synthetic/deepfake content

**Source:** EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689), Article 50 (official text)

**Key facts:**

- The Act sets transparency obligations for certain AI outputs, including synthetic/deepfake-style content and generated content (with specific scopes and exceptions).
- The regulation text includes explicit "transparency obligations" language in Article 50, and it includes an "apply from" schedule elsewhere in the Regulation.

**Relevance to SI8:**

- Supports the claim that documented workflow + disclosure readiness is becoming a compliance requirement in major jurisdictions.
- Validates Chain of Title fields: #2 (Model disclosure), #3 (Rights Verified sign-off), #9 (Version history) plus your planned "platform-compliant delivery" checklist.

**Practical SI8 claim line that's defensible:**
"We maintain the disclosure and provenance records you'll need as transparency requirements expand (e.g., EU AI Act Article 50)."

---

### Finding 4 — New York disclosure law for AI-generated "synthetic performers" in ads (effective 2026)

**Source:** New York Assembly bill page / summary for the synthetic performer disclosure law (official legislative page)

**Key facts:**

- Requires conspicuous disclosure when "synthetic performers" are used in advertising (effective date and details are in the enacted bill materials).

**Relevance to SI8:**

- Reinforces that ad/brand workflows will need documentation + disclosure logic (not just "cool video").
- Validates Chain of Title fields: #3, #6, #9 (and a future "disclosure-ready" field if you add it).

---

### Finding 5 — U.S. Copyright Office: AI-generated works need disclosure; human authorship matters

**Source:** U.S. Copyright Office AI guidance hub + policy guidance PDF

**Key facts:**

- USCO requires applicants to disclose AI-generated content and limits registration to the human-authored aspects when AI-generated material is present.

**Relevance to SI8:**

- Strong support for your Human Authorship Declaration + Version History logic as a "copyrightability posture" layer (even if you're not filing registrations).
- Validates Chain of Title fields: #9 (Version history) and your submission requirement "human authorship declaration" (even though it's not one of the 9 fields today).

---

## Section 4: Platform policies (distribution enablement is a real value)

### Finding 6 — TikTok: labeling requirements for synthetic media / AI-generated content

**Source:** TikTok policy/help page on AI-generated/synthetic media labeling

**Key facts:**

- TikTok requires labeling/disclosure for certain AI-generated or manipulated media; enforcement includes removal in some cases.

**Relevance to SI8:**

- Your Chain of Title supports platform compliance (the "paperwork" to ship content safely).
- Validates fields: #2, #3, #9 (and a "platform labeling compliance" checklist you may want to formalize).

---

### Finding 7 — YouTube: disclosure expectations for altered/synthetic content (creator-side compliance)

**Source:** YouTube Help (Google support thread / help content around disclosure)

**Key facts:**

- YouTube has disclosure tooling / expectations around "altered or synthetic" content in relevant contexts.

**Relevance to SI8:** Same as above—distribution enablement.

---

## Section 5: Fair use & CMI preservation (what's concrete right now)

### Finding 8 — DMCA 1202/1203: removing or altering "copyright management information" can trigger separate liability

**Sources:**

- 17 U.S.C. § 1202 (CMI prohibition)
- 17 U.S.C. § 1203 (civil remedies / statutory damages for 1202 violations)

**Key facts:**

- DMCA 1202 targets removal/alteration of CMI (and distribution knowing CMI has been removed/altered) with knowledge/intent elements.
- DMCA 1203 provides civil remedies and statutory damages structure for certain violations.

**Relevance to SI8:**

- Your "Chain of Title" idea can credibly expand into: "we preserve provenance/CMI-like records and don't strip attribution/metadata."
- Validates fields: #1, #2, #9 (and suggests you may want a dedicated "metadata/CMI handling" line item in your process).

---

## Section 6: Competitive landscape evidence (documentation layer as the value)

### Finding 9 — Getty-style value proposition: "commercially clean" + indemnity is the product layer

**Source:** Reporting on Getty's generative AI tool and indemnification framing

**Key facts:**

- Getty positions its genAI offering as trained on licensed content and marketed for commercial use; indemnification is a key enterprise value prop in this category.

**Relevance to SI8:**

- Supports your structural claim: buyers pay for defensibility + paperwork + risk posture, not the pixels.
- Validates your "Chain of Title is the product" positioning.

---

### Finding 10 — Adobe positioning: not training on customer data (trust posture is central)

**Source:** Axios on Adobe terms clarifying customer-data training pledge

**Relevance to SI8:** Reinforces that "trust / provenance / governance" is a core competitive axis, not a niche.

---

## Section 7: Cases where documentation fails (limits you should be explicit about)

Here's the clean, honest line (supported by the statutory structure and regulatory reality above):

- **Documentation cannot prevent lawsuits.** Anyone can sue; and if infringement is real, "good process" doesn't magically make it non-infringement.

**Documentation most reliably helps with:**

- damage posture (willfulness vs. non-willful; sometimes innocent infringement),
- compliance posture (disclosure obligations, platform rules),
- distribution readiness (fewer internal legal blocks, faster approvals).

**What you should not claim without additional, very specific sources:**

- "This documentation prevents liability," "breaks vicarious liability," "guarantees legal clearance," or "is equivalent to indemnification."

---

## Section 8: Direct quotes you can safely reuse (short excerpts)

- Innocent infringement floor ($200) — 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2)
- EU AI Act transparency obligations — Article 50 text (use short excerpt, not a long paste)
- USCO AI guidance — disclosure + human authorship framing (use their wording carefully and briefly)
- TikTok labeling policy — short excerpt on labeling requirement

If you want, paste one draft "Risk Briefing" entry and I'll rewrite it using only quote-length excerpts that stay within your compliance limits.

---

## Section 9: Quantifiable metrics (the ones you can defend right now)

- Statutory damages ranges (per work): $750–$30,000 (standard), up to $150,000 (willful), down to $200 (innocent).
- Minimum statutory-damages reduction from $750 to $200 = 73.3% (math derived from statute).
- NY synthetic-performer disclosure law: penalties/effective date are in the official bill materials; cite the bill page when you quote numbers.

---

## Section 10: Open questions & gaps (what research did NOT prove)

- **Direct AI-video precedent:** I did not find a clean, court-citable statement (2024–2026) that says "provenance logs reduce liability for brands using AI video outputs." The support is analogical (copyright damages posture, disclosure laws, platform compliance), not a definitive AI-output safe harbor.
- **E&O insurance eligibility:** I didn't pull a primary insurer underwriting checklist in this research pass (and E&O varies by carrier). Your "Chain of Title = chain-of-title-like artifact" is directionally right, but I would treat "enables E&O insurance" as a hypothesis to validate with a broker, not a marketing claim yet.
- **Adobe indemnification scope:** I didn't capture Adobe's actual indemnity contract language in a primary source here. Don't compare indemnity scopes in marketing without quoting the exact plan terms.

## What SI8 can say (defensible) vs. can't say (overpromise)

### ✅ Defensible claims (with citations above)

- "Our Chain of Title creates a documented audit trail of tool provenance, authorization, and review decisions."
- "Documentation can materially improve your damages posture (e.g., helps argue against willfulness; in some cases supports 'innocent infringement' arguments)."
- "Disclosure and transparency obligations are expanding (e.g., EU AI Act Article 50, NY synthetic-performer disclosure law). We maintain the records needed for compliance."
- "Platform policies increasingly expect labeling/disclosure for synthetic media; we support platform-compliant delivery."
- "We don't sell 'rights-cleared.' We sell a documented process ('Rights Verified vetted') and the paperwork your legal team can review."

### ❌ Claims to avoid (unless you later obtain very specific support + tighten contracts)

- "Prevents lawsuits," "guarantees clearance," "eliminates liability," "indemnifies," "E&O insurance guaranteed."

## If you want this turned into SI8-ready assets

Tell me which one you want first and I'll write it in your tone ("won't get you sued," but disciplined):

1. A Risk Briefing web page template (6–8 entries) with compliant citation formatting.
2. A 1-page buyer explainer: "Why the file is the carrier, the Chain of Title is the product" (with only defensible claims).
3. A battlecard vs. Adobe/stock libraries/AI studios that cleanly distinguishes "provenance metadata" vs "legal defensibility workflow."
