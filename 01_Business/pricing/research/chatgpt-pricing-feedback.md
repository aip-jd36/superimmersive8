## Recommended Pricing Structure

| Tier | Price | Positioning |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Rights-Verified AI Asset (Tier 1) | $1,000-$3,000 | Digital/social, limited territory, non-exclusive |
| Tier 2 Placement / Premium | $4,000-$10,000+ | Regeneration, exclusivity, broader rights |

---

## Value Positioning

**Stock footage context:**
- ~$400-$500 = no rights defense
- SI8 $1,000+ = defensible + documented

**Why premium justified:**
- Legal risk mitigation
- Chain of Title documentation
- Modification rights clarity
- Category exclusivity options

---

## Strategic Insight

**Lower pricing unlocks:**
- Lower-budget buyers
- Faster closing
- Repeat business
- Build credibility → anchor higher tiers later

**Doesn't cheapen premium:**
- Clear differentiation between tiers
- Value ladder pricing model
- $1K for standard digital
- $4K+ for strategic/broadcast
- $10K+ for enterprise

---

## Behavioral Insight

Pure stock (Getty/Shutterstock) is cheap but doesn't provide:
- Rights verification process
- Legal documentation beyond standard terms
- Chain of Title for AI-specific risks

SI8's premium = legal defense layer, not just pixels.
