# Gemini Pricing Feedback — February 21, 2026

## Summary

Strong recommendation for $1,500 floor (not $1,000, not $5,000). Provided detailed competitor analysis validating the $1,500-$3,000 range for Tier 1.

---

## The Comparables

### 1. Filmsupply (Premium Stock Video)
**Model:** Represents high-end human filmmakers, licenses cinematic footage to agencies

**Pricing:**
- Digital/web: $500-$2,500
- Broadcast: $5,000-$15,000+

**Why it matters:** If they charge $1.5K for real human footage, charging $5K for AI without custom integration is uncompetitive.

---

### 2. Catch&Release (Legal Clearance)
**Model:** Finds viral/UGC video, clears IP, handles legal paperwork, provides indemnification

**Pricing:**
- Clearance fee + licensing: $1,500-$4,000 for digital

**Why it matters:** Proves agencies pay $2,000+ purely for legal shield and paperwork. Validates SI8's Chain of Title value.

---

### 3. Getty Rights-Managed
**Model:** High-end, exclusive, historically significant clips

**Pricing:**
- Digital/corporate: $800-$3,000
- Depends on audience size, duration

**Why it matters:** SI8's $1,500-$3,000 aligns with Getty's digital tier.

## The New Pricing Ladder

**Psychological effect of $1,500 floor:**

When buyers see:
- Tier 1: $1,500 → "Reasonable for premium, legally-cleared content"
- Tier 2: $12,000 → "Big jump, but we get brand integration + exclusivity vs. $50K production? Steal."

**Lowering Tier 1 makes Tier 2 look like high-ROI alternative.**

---

## Commission Math (Gemini's Analysis)

**At $2,000 average Tier 1 sale:**
- Filmmaker: 75% = $1,500 (Note: Gemini used old 75/25 split; we updated to 80/20)
- SI8: 25% = $500
- Effective hourly: ~$300/hour for 90-min vetting

**Quote:** "For a Year 1 solo founder, that is highly respectable and profitable."

---

## Revenue Path to $5K/Month

**10 Tier 1 licenses @ $2K = $5K commission**
OR
**2 Tier 1 + 1 Tier 2 ($15K) = $400 + $3,750 = ~$4K**

---

## The Verdict: $1,500

**Why $1,500 is the magic number:**
- Low enough for agency producer's credit card (no CFO approval)
- High enough to signal "Premium/Enterprise Grade"
- Not $200 Envato Elements clips
- Not $5,000 sticker shock

**Quote:** "$1,500 is a magic number in B2B."
