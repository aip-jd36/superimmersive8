# SI8 Pricing — Decisions Log

A record of what changed between versions, why, and what remains unresolved.

## v1.0 — February 21, 2026

### What We Decided

**1. Three-tier model:**
- Standard License: Starting at $1,500
- Extended License: $2,500-$5,000 (custom quote)
- Custom AI Placement: $12,000-$20,000+

**2. Floor price: $1,500 (not $1,000, not $5,000)**

**Rationale:**
- $1,000 too commodity (signals cheap stock, weak commission)
- $5,000 too high (sticker shock, no track record yet)
- $1,500 = premium B2B sweet spot (on credit card, under CFO approval)
- Matches competitors: Filmsupply ($500-$2,500), Catch&Release ($1,500-$4,000), Getty RM ($800-$3,000)

**3. Commission: 20% SI8 / 80% filmmaker**

**Rationale:**
- Changed from 25/75 to be more competitive
- Industry standard for premium representation: 15-20%
- $1,500 sale = $300 SI8 = $200/hr for 90-min vetting (profitable)
- $15,000 Tier 2 deal = $3,000 SI8 (strong incentive)

**4. Positioning: Premium (Getty-style), not commodity (Shutterstock-style)**

**Rationale:**
- Chain of Title = premium value-add
- Rights Verified = legal risk reduction (worth premium)
- Target: mid-market agencies with real budgets, not volume/DIY creators

**5. Public pricing: Show Tier 1 price, "Custom Quote" for Tier 2 & 3**

**Rationale:**
- Transparency builds trust for entry tier
- Custom quote for Tier 2/3 allows flexibility
- Avoids complex pricing calculators (Year 1 too early)

### Research Sources

**Internal:**
- Stock video research agent (Feb 21, 2026)
- Getty/Shutterstock/Adobe Stock pricing analysis
- Filmsupply, Catch&Release, Pond5 comparables

**Peer Review:**
- ChatGPT feedback (Feb 21, 2026): Recommended $1K-$3K range, validated $1,500 floor
- Gemini feedback (Feb 21, 2026): Validated $1,500 floor, cited Filmsupply/Catch&Release comparables

---

### What Changed from Initial Thinking

**Before:** Considered $299-$799 range (mimicking cheap stock footage)
**After:** $1,500-$20,000+ range (premium positioning)

**Why:** SI8 is not stock footage. SI8 is rights-cleared premium content + legal documentation. Commodity pricing would undermine the entire value proposition.

### Open Questions (v1.0)

**Pricing structure:**
- [ ] Show Extended pricing publicly or keep "Custom Quote"?
- [ ] Should category exclusivity be separate add-on or folded into Extended?
- [ ] Need a "Broadcast" tier between Extended and Custom Placement?

**Volume & discounts:**
- [ ] Volume discount threshold: 3, 5, or 10 assets?
- [ ] Subscription option in Year 2?
- [ ] Annual unlimited access (Netflix-style)?

**Add-ons:**
- [ ] Modification rights pricing for brands who want to edit/adapt?
- [ ] Rush delivery fee: $500 or $1,000?
- [ ] Legal consultation add-on: $500 for 30-min with lawyer?

**Commission:**
- [ ] Keep 20/80 split for all tiers or adjust for Tier 2? (Could go 25/75 for high-value deals)
- [ ] Volume deals: lower commission if buying 10+ assets?
