# SI8 Pricing Strategy — Project Overview

**Purpose:** Document SI8's pricing evolution, competitive research, and strategic decisions.

**Current Version:** v1.0 (February 2026)

## How This Project Works

This is a living project that will evolve as SI8 gains real market data. Like the Rights Playbook and Chain of Title projects, pricing decisions are versioned and justified.

### Document Structure

## Current Pricing Model (v1.0)

**Philosophy:** Premium positioning (Getty-style) over volume/commodity (Shutterstock-style)

### Three Tiers

| Tier | Price Range | What It Is |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Standard License** | Starting at $1,500 | Catalog licensing (digital/social/web, 1 year, non-exclusive) |
| **Extended License** | $2,500-$5,000 | Broadcast/commercial, broader territory, category-exclusive options |
| **Custom AI Placement** | $12,000-$20,000+ | Tier 2 product placement — brand integration via AI regeneration |

### Key Comparables

- **Filmsupply:** $500-$2,500 (cinematic stock, digital)
- **Catch&Release:** $1,500-$4,000 (legal clearance + licensing)
- **Getty Rights-Managed:** $800-$3,000 (digital/corporate)

### Strategic Rationale

1. **$1,500 floor** — Premium B2B signal, not commodity
2. **Commission math works** — $375-$500 SI8 commission per Tier 1 deal = $300-400/hour for 90-min vetting
3. **Tier 2 contrast** — $1,500 → $12,000 makes custom placement look like great value vs. $50K traditional production
4. **APAC positioning** — $1,500 accessible but premium (credit card threshold)

## Open Questions (v1.0)

- Should we show tiered pricing or "Starting at $1,500" + custom quotes?
- Volume discounts? (e.g., 5+ assets = 15% off)
- Annual subscription option in Year 2?
- How to price category exclusivity add-on? (Flat $1,500 or % markup?)
- Broadcast rights: separate tier or add-on?

## Next Steps

1. **Create pricing page** (website)
2. **Test messaging** with 3-5 friendly prospects
3. **Iterate after first 3 deals** close
4. **v1.1 update** after real market feedback
