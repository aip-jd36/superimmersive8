## Strategic Rationale

### Why $1,500 Floor (Not $1,000)

**The $1,000 trap:**
- Signals commodity/marketplace positioning
- Too close to cheap stock footage ($39-$500)
- Makes Tier 2 jump feel enormous (12-15x)
- Commission too low ($200 SI8 at $1,000)
- Anchors brand perception low permanently

**The $1,500 advantage:**
- Premium B2B signal without luxury pricing
- "Magic number" — on credit card, under CFO approval
- Clean commission math ($300/hr for 90-min vetting)
- Makes Tier 2 look like great value (8x upgrade vs. 12x)
- Room to discount quietly without public anchor damage

**Why not $5,000 floor:**
- Sticker shock for mid-market APAC agencies
- No catalog track record to justify premium over Filmsupply
- Blocks volume/momentum in Year 1
- Out of step with comparable premium stock ($500-$2,500)

---

## Competitive Context

### Premium Stock Video (The Aesthetic Analogue)

**Filmsupply**
- Premium cinematic stock footage
- Digital/web: $500-$2,500
- Broadcast: $5,000-$15,000+
- Represents high-end human filmmakers

**Takeaway:** If human-made cinematic stock is $1,500 digital, AI content with legal packaging should be similar or higher.

---

### Legal Clearance Agencies (The Structural Analogue)

**Catch&Release**
- Finds viral/UGC video on social
- Clears IP, handles legal docs, provides indemnification
- Pricing: $1,500-$4,000 for digital usage

**Takeaway:** Agencies pay $2,000+ purely for legal paperwork. This validates SI8's Chain of Title value.

---

### Getty Images Rights-Managed

**Getty RM Video**
- High-end, exclusive, or historically significant clips
- Digital/corporate: $800-$3,000
- Broadcast: $3,000-$10,000+

**Takeaway:** SI8's $1,500-$3,000 range aligns with Getty's digital tier, justified by Rights Verified process.

---

### Traditional Stock (The Non-Competitor)

**Shutterstock / Adobe Stock**
- Subscription: $8-$30/video (high volume)
- À la carte: $39-$200/clip
- No legal vetting, no Chain of Title

**Takeaway:** Not a competitor. SI8 is premium tier, not commodity.

## Commission Math

### Tier 1 Standard License ($1,500-$3,000)

| Sale Price | Filmmaker (80%) | SI8 (20%) | Effective Hourly (90min vetting) |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| $1,500 | $1,200 | $300 | $200/hr |
| $2,000 | $1,600 | $400 | $267/hr |
| $2,500 | $2,000 | $500 | $333/hr |
| $3,000 | $2,400 | $600 | $400/hr |

**Target average:** $2,000-$2,500 per Tier 1 deal = **$400-$500 SI8 commission**

---

### Tier 2 Extended License ($2,500-$5,000)

| Sale Price | SI8 (20%) |
|------------|-----------|
| $2,500 | $500 |
| $3,500 | $700 |
| $5,000 | $1,000 |

---

### Tier 3 Custom AI Placement ($12,000-$20,000+)

| Sale Price | SI8 (20%) | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| $12,000 | $2,400 | Minimum viable placement deal |
| $15,000 | $3,000 | Target average |
| $20,000 | $4,000 | Premium/complex integration |
| $30,000+ | $6,000+ | Enterprise/broadcast/multi-market |

---

## Revenue Scenarios

### Path to $5K/Month (10-15 hrs/week, solo founder)

**Option A: Volume Tier 1**
- 10 Standard Licenses @ $2,000 avg = $4,000 SI8 commission
- Requires: Strong catalog, consistent outreach, fast closing

**Option B: Mixed Tier 1 + Tier 2**
- 5 Standard @ $2,000 = $2,000
- 1 Custom Placement @ $15,000 = $3,000
- **Total: $5,000/month**
- More realistic for Year 1

**Option C: Two Tier 2 Deals**
- 2 Custom Placements @ $15,000 = $6,000
- Fewer deals, higher effort per deal
- Harder to sustain monthly

## Discount Policy (Internal Only)

**When to discount:**
- Early adopter / first 3 deals: 10-20% off
- Friendly introductions / advisors: 15% off
- Multi-asset bundles: 10-15% off (5+ assets)
- Non-profit / educational use: Case-by-case

**When NOT to discount:**
- Broadcast rights (hold price)
- Category exclusivity (hold price)
- Custom AI Placement (Tier 2 services should never discount below $10K)

**How to frame discounts:**
- "Early access pricing" (not "discount")
- "Introductory rate" (time-limited)
- "Multi-asset package pricing" (volume)

---

## Add-Ons (Future Consideration)

**Possible à la carte upgrades:**
- Category exclusivity: +$1,500
- Extended duration (3yr → perpetual): +$1,000
- Additional territories: +$500 per region
- Rush delivery (7 days): +$500
- Legal consultation (30-min with lawyer): +$500

Not implemented in v1.0 — revisit after 10+ deals.

---

## Success Metrics

**After 5 deals:**
- Average Tier 1 sale price
- Conversion rate by tier
- Which pricing objections came up
- Geographic price sensitivity (APAC vs. other)

**After 10 deals:**
- Update pricing model to v1.1
- Adjust tiers if needed
- Consider volume discounts / subscription

---

## Open Questions (v1.0)

1. Should we publicly show Extended pricing or keep it "Custom Quote"?
2. Should category exclusivity be a separate add-on or folded into Extended?
3. Do we need a "Broadcast" tier between Extended and Custom Placement?
4. How to price modification rights for brands who want to edit/adapt?
5. Volume discount threshold: 3 assets? 5 assets? 10 assets?
6. Annual subscription in Year 2: Netflix-style unlimited access?
